MARKET OVERVIEW
▪Indian equity markets ended the September 2025 quarter in negative territory, with 
benchmark indices like Nifty 50 and Sensex falling 3.6% and 4.0% respectively, while 
broader indices such as Nifty Midcap 150 and Smallcap 250 declined by 4.3% and 6.2%.
▪The market decline was driven by weaker corporate earnings and global headwinds such 
as economic slowdown, trade policy uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions, which 
overshadowed brief domestic optimism from GST 2.0 reforms.
▪Investor sentiment which was already impacted by delays in U.S. trade policy, was further 
weakened by the introduction of a one-time H1-B visa fee and a 100% tariff on branded 
drug imports, affecting globally exposed sectors.
▪Despite near-term volatility, India remains well-positioned for long-term growth, supported 
by structural strengths, rising capital expenditure, and consumption boosts from the Union 
Budget and GST 2.0 reforms.
▪Market sentiment remains cautious, with large-cap stocks offering relative safety and 
domestically focused sectors expected to outperform export-driven ones, reinforcing the 
view that while short-term turbulence may persist, India’s long-term investment outlook 
remains strong.
▪Domestic debt markets were shaped by tariff concerns, S&P’s sovereign rating upgrade, 
GST rationalization, and resilient GDP growth, which supported investor sentiment.
▪High-frequency indicators showed early signs of improvement, driven by GST reforms 
and past policy actions, while a weak inflation base set the stage for stronger prints 
ahead.
▪The U.S. Fed initiated its first rate cut of 2025, signaling further easing, while the RBI 
maintained a steady rate stance with a bias toward easing amid trade and policy 
uncertainties.
▪To stimulate credit growth and enhance liquidity, the RBI announced several banking 
reforms, including the relaxation of regulatory limits, which are expected to support 
lending and financial sector resilience.
▪India’s 10-year government bond yield closed the quarter at 6.63%, up 24 bps, but eased 
9 bps post-policy amid dovish commentary. We favor a carry-focused strategy over 
duration plays, anticipating the 10-year yield to remain within the 6.20%–6.70% range. 
Our constructive stance on the 1–5-year segment is driven by the superior risk-reward 
offered by high-quality bonds.
We remain constructive on the short to medium end of the yield curve. Short Duration 
funds, Banking & PSU Debt funds, Corporate Bond funds, Medium Duration funds, Money 
Market funds, Low Duration funds and Ultra Short Duration funds can be considered by 
investors with an investment horizon commensurate with the maturity profile of the schemes. 
Investors can consider investing in Medium Duration as per their risk appetite with an 
investment horizon of at least 2-3 years to avoid any intermittent volatility.
We maintain a positive bias towards the Indian equity markets. Investors can consider 
investing in equities with a 3-to-5-year investment perspective.

EQUITY INVESTMENT STRATEGY
Market Update – Recap:
•
The Indian equity market remained rangebound with a downward bias during the quarter, following a 
strong rally in the previous months. While September saw a mild recovery, it lacked conviction due to 
weak corporate earnings and persistent global headwinds including economic slowdown, trade policy 
uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions.
•
Domestic sentiment was briefly lifted by GST 2.0 reforms, but gains were capped due to currency 
depreciation, FII outflows, and inventory overhang from GST rate cuts.
•
Investor confidence was further shaken by recent US policy changes, notably the imposition of a one-
time fee for new H1-B visa applicants and a 100% tariff on branded drug imports, which raised 
concerns for export-oriented sectors and dampened overall sentiment.
•
We focus on ‘Growth at a Reasonable Price’, favoring quality corporates, market leaders, and 
domestically oriented companies, while selectively investing in capex-driven opportunities with clear 
growth visibility. Large caps offer valuation comfort, and we remain cautious on export-oriented 
sectors amid global uncertainties.

Performance of Asset Classes: Focus on Asset Allocation for FY26:
•
Asset class leadership continues to shift across market cycles, with gold emerging as the top performer in 
2025 - driven by safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions and uncertainty surrounding the US 
protectionist agenda.
•
Gold maintained its leadership after briefly losing momentum post May 2024, reclaiming the top spot by 
October. On a YTD basis, it remains the best-performing asset globally.
•
Domestically, the broader market led returns in 2023 and most of 2024, but a sharp correction since 
October 2024 impacted overall performance. Signs of recovery have emerged over the past 3–4 months.
•
Nifty 50 ranked at the bottom in 2024 for the first time, primarily due to sustained FII selling in the last 
quarter, reflecting global risk aversion and valuation concerns.
•
Despite recent volatility, we remain constructive on India’s long-term equity outlook, supported by rising 
capex, improving credit growth, and a favorable economic structure. However, earnings growth will be key 
to driving returns, given limited room for valuation expansion.
•
Our outlook for CY25 is cautiously optimistic, with expectations of market consolidation. Strategic asset 
allocation and sector rotation will be critical, and investors should leverage volatility to build long-term 
positions.

EQUITY MARKET OUTLOOK
India remains well-positioned for long-term growth, supported by structural strengths, rising 
capex, and consumption tailwinds from the Union Budget and GST 2.0 reforms. Economic 
momentum is expected to revive in FY26, aided by policy rate cuts, improved liquidity, and fiscal 
support. However, risks persist from geopolitical tensions, trade negotiation delays—especially 
U.S. tariffs linked to oil imports—and increased visa fees impacting the IT sector. While fiscal and 
monetary measures are in place, delayed policy transmission may keep sentiment cautious. 
Encouragingly, rural demand is recovering, and continued government spending could help offset 
domestic risks. Despite near-term headwinds, corporate earnings are expected to remain healthy 
in H2FY26, with valuations likely supported by strong domestic flows and equities’ relative appeal 
over bonds. The proposed GST rationalization and supportive policy measures are expected to 
cushion the economy and stimulate demand, though fiscal slippage remains a risk.
Historically, large caps have outperformed mid and small caps during periods of uncertainty due 
to stronger balance sheets and higher institutional ownership. With ongoing global policy 
uncertainty, tariff risks, and uneven earnings, large caps remain relatively resilient. The midcap 
premium to large caps has declined from 72% in Sep’24 to ~30%, only slightly above the 10-
year average of 25%. Small-cap valuations, with a 25% premium, also remain elevated versus 
historical norms, though significantly lower than 2024 highs. This leaves mid and small caps 
vulnerable if earnings momentum weakens or global risk appetite remains subdued.
Investors can look at accumulating equities with a 3-to-5-year investment  
perspective
From a market positioning standpoint, risk-reward is gradually shifting toward broader markets, 
while large caps continue to offer a safety net. Recovery is expected to be gradual, led by strong 
earnings, improving liquidity, and stable macro fundamentals. In the near term, markets may 
consolidate with narrow breadth. Our strategy remains focused on ‘Growth at a Reasonable 
Price’, favoring quality, market leaders, and domestic sectors like BFSI, Telecom, Consumption, 
Hospitals, and interest-rate proxies. We also prefer select capex-driven opportunities with clear 
growth visibility, while remaining cautious on export-oriented sectors due to macro and 
geopolitical risks.
Given the above, markets are expected to remain vigilant amid ongoing trade tariff developments 
and geopolitical shifts. In response, corporates are actively pursuing geographic diversification to 
mitigate external risks. Coordinated efforts between the government and private sector will be 
crucial in navigating these challenges and sustaining earnings momentum. The direction of tariff 
negotiations, progress on domestic policy reforms, and trends in high-frequency economic 
indicators will play a pivotal role in shaping market sentiment. While we maintain a cautious 
stance in the near term due to macro uncertainties, we remain constructive on Indian equities 
from a long-term perspective, supported by strong structural fundamentals and improving 
domestic drivers.

India’s corporate earnings have seen downgrades over the past year, but signs of stabilization 
are emerging, with the latest revisions at their lowest in four quarters. Nifty 50’s PAT growth is 
expected to be in the lower double digits for FY26, supported by improving macro conditions, 
policy measures, and strong corporate balance sheets. Financials and domestically focused 
sectors are likely to benefit from lower rates, surplus liquidity, and rising consumption. While 
export-oriented sectors face risks from geopolitical tensions and trade issues, upcoming 
quarterly results will be key in shaping market direction.

•
India’s CPI inflation rose to 2.07% YoY, marking a modest uptick from July’s 1.61%, largely driven 
by food price normalization. However, vegetable prices remain below August 2023 levels, and 
seasonal increases have been weaker than expected. Early September trends suggest a return to 
below-average levels, although a typical seasonal rise is still anticipated.
•
Core inflation held steady at 4.21%, with gold prices contributing to the uptick in personal care 
inflation. Other core components, such as clothing, recreation, and education, showed signs of 
moderation. Supercore inflation measures, including the weighted median and core ex-petro and 
precious metals, also softened, indicating underlying price stability.
•
These trends support expectations of FY26 inflation remaining below 3%, though FY27 inflation 
could rise to 4.5–5.0%, driven by base effects and consumption-supportive measures like GST rate 
shifts. While the RBI has signaled the end of rate cuts, markets are beginning to price in potential 
hikes within the next two years.
•
On the wholesale side, WPI inflation rose to 0.52%, the highest since April 2025, reversing 
deflationary trends seen in previous months. This was led by higher manufacturing inflation and 
reduced food price deflation. Notably, vegetables contributed 0.69 percentage points to the monthly 
increase, while basic metals added 0.15 points, reflecting rising industrial metal prices and INR 
weakness. Gold added a further 0.04 points.
•
The WPI uptick signals a shift toward domestically driven inflation and a reduction in imported 
deflation. This has implications for GDP calculations, as low WPI manufacturing inflation can lead to 
overestimation of manufacturing GVA due to the single deflation method. Sustained higher metals 
prices may suppress GVA growth.
•
In summary, while inflation remains contained in the near term, upside risks for FY27 are emerging. 
The RBI’s cautious stance reflects this balance.

THE UPSIDE IN FY27

FLECKS 
OF 
GREEN 
IN 
INDIA 
HIGH- 
FREQUENCY INDICATORS
•
High-frequency activity indicators are now showing signs of bottoming out, with better prints related 
to transportation, urban retail sales and the rural sector being seen. 
•
The HSBC Flash India Composite Output Index, which measures India’s manufacturing and 
service sectors, fell to 61.9 in September from 63.2 in August, marking a modest slowdown but still 
indicating a sharp rate of expansion. Growth in factory output outpaced that of services, although 
the pace of increase moderated across both sectors. The HSBC Flash India Manufacturing PMI 
slipped to 58.5 in September from August’s final 59.3, while the HSBC Flash India Services PMI fell 
to 61.6 in September from 62.9 in August 2025.
•
India's GST collections hit Rs 1.89 lakh crore in September, a 9.1% YoY increase, defying 
expectations of a consumption slowdown. This robust growth, reflecting August transactions, 
indicates a resilient domestic economy and strong discretionary demand.
•
The trends in digital transaction have shown signs of some cool-off, even though the UPI volumes 
have risen 33% on-year in Q2FY26 while values rose 20.9%. During September, UPI transactions 
slipped to 19.6 billion from 20.01 billion in August, with FASTag volumes too easing, growing at a 
slower pace of 4.6% in September from 12.8% in August.
•
The auto sector capped the quarter on a strong note, with PV and  rural economy stood out, as 
tractor sales surged over 40% across businesses. Two-wheeler makers too gained ground.
•
India's overall unemployment rate was 5.1% in August 2025, a decline from the previous month's 
5.2% and 5.6% in June, showing positive trends in the labor market.

RESURGANCE OF SAFE HAVENS :  GOLD AND 
SILVER LEAD THE WAY
•
Gold and silver have delivered exceptional returns in 2025, with gold rising nearly 50% and silver 
surging 65%. Both metals have outperformed major global equity indices, driven by a weaker 
dollar, stable interest rates, and heightened geopolitical uncertainty..
•
Silver’s gains are driven by rising industrial demand, especially from green energy applications, 
while gold’s rally reflects safe-haven demand, central bank buying, and a softening dollar.
•
Gold’s performance in 2025 mirrors trends seen during past crisis periods, reaffirming its role as a 
reliable hedge. In India, prices have been bolstered by a weaker rupee and growing investment 
demand through ETFs and physical gold bars.
•
According to our Economic Research team, gold surged sharply in September due to geopolitical 
risks and U.S. policy concerns, nearing USD 4,000/oz—hitting the medium-term target earlier than 
expected.
•
With fiscal dominance and elevated money supply growth, gold is now forecasted to trend toward 
USD 5,000/oz, though intermediate corrections may occur due to rate expectations and dollar 
fluctuations.
•
Silver is expected to follow gold’s trajectory with higher volatility, and both metals are likely to 
sustain elevated levels through 2026, reinforcing their role as strategic portfolio diversifiers.
•
Investors should consider allocating 10–15% of their portfolio to precious metals via SIPs, 
depending on risk appetite and long-term goals, to hedge against uncertainty and enhance portfolio 
stability.

WHAT DIRECTION IS THE NEXT INDIA RATE 
MOVE
•
India’s high-frequency indicators are improving, supported by GST reforms and past policy actions that 
continue to drive credit growth, while global trends point to steepening yield curves and currency 
weakness.
•
September marked a turning point for fixed income markets, with the U.S. Fed initiating its first rate cut 
of 2025 and India receiving a sovereign rating upgrade from Japan’s R&I, boosting sentiment.
•
Rising SDL yields and INR depreciation reflect fiscal concerns, arriving earlier than expected; market 
positioning is stretched, with potential for short covering and OMO support.
•
The RBI held rates steady with a dovish bias, revising FY27 growth upward and keeping inflation 
expectations at 4.5%, while liquidity remains tight due to tax flows and FX defense.
•
Mixed trends in India’s bond market continue, with shorter-duration issuance gaining traction, deposit 
growth staying weak, and liquidity management challenged by elevated CD/OIS spreads.
•
OIS pricing suggests no further rate cuts, with expectations of a 25 bps hike in two years and possibly 
50 bps in three, indicating a shift in rate expectations. Despite global volatility, 10-year G-sec yields 
are aggressively priced and may be near bottom compared to global benchmarks.
•
India’s bond yields are expected to remain range-bound, influenced by supply concerns and potential 
rate hikes. Global factors, including U.S. monetary policy, continue to shape sentiment, with longer-
end rates already rising and 10-year G-sec yields trading below U.S. Treasuries on a fully hedged 
basis.

INR 
WEAKENING, 
REGARDLESS 
OF 
USD 
RISING OR FALLING
Source: Axis Bank Economic Research, Axis Bank Investment Research
•
The US dollar experienced significant volatility in September, influenced by softer labour market 
data and declining consumer confidence, which were compounded by dovish comments from new 
Fed Governor Miran. Meanwhile, political developments in Japan suggested delayed rate hikes, 
and fiscal concerns in the UK added to global uncertainty.
•
Indian markets initially reacted by selling USD, anticipating a shift toward easier Fed policy. 
However, this move was reversed as other FOMC members pushed back against dovish 
expectations, resulting in only one dissent in the final decision and restoring some strength to the 
dollar.
•
In Asia, the PBOC and SAFE appeared comfortable with the Chinese yuan stabilising around the 
7.10 level, similar to past cycles. In contrast, the ECB is turning more hawkish due to increased 
fiscal spending linked to the Ukraine war, while the yen is appreciating on expectations of policy 
continuity under a likely new Prime Minister Koizumi.
•
The Indian rupee continues to face depreciation pressure, with the RBI actively intervening to 
defend spot levels, most recently capping the INR at around 88.80. Persistent financial outflows, 
muted ECB inflows, and structural issues in capital flows—such as FDI repatriation and strong 
domestic investor interest—have contributed to this pressure.
•
Since mid-2023, India’s core balance of payments (excluding interest payments to RBI, 
sterilisation flows, and FPI flows) has turned negative, making even small current account deficits 
difficult to finance. With the RBI continuing to ease domestic monetary conditions and liberalise 
capital flows, financial outflows are likely to persist. This, combined with the need to rebuild FX 
reserves—now approaching the lower bound of adequacy—suggests continued weakness in the 
INR, with a breach of 89.00 increasingly likely.
INR has been an underperformer when compared to all peer indices

DEBT AND MACRO ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
Source: Axis Bank Economic Research, Axis Bank Investment Research
CPI inflation eases on food deflation reversal
▪CPI inflation rose to 2.07% YoY in August 2025, primarily driven by a reversal in food deflation, 
indicating renewed price pressures in the food category.
▪Core inflation remained sticky at 4.1% YoY, as services continued to exert upward pressure, 
reflecting persistent demand-side price rigidity.
▪WPI inflation was mild at 0.52%, with upward momentum coming from non-food manufactured 
goods and rising input costs.
CAD narrows, net capital flows turn negative
▪India’s CAD was at USD 9.8 bn. The narrower merchandise trade deficit is partly because 
imports fell more sharply than exports and gold imports in particular dipped.
▪Net capital flows turned negative as sharp FPI outflows driven by US tariff tensions, weak 
corporate earnings and rupee depreciation outweighed modest debt inflows.
•
Domestic debt markets were shaped by tariff concerns, GST rationalization, resilient GDP 
growth, and S&P’s upgrade of India’s sovereign rating from BBB- to BBB, which reflects 
confidence in fiscal discipline, capex-led spending (3.1% of GDP), and stable inflation 
expectations, although the direct impact on bond pricing has been limited.
•
RBI maintained a neutral stance and held rates, lowering its inflation forecast to 2.6% and 
raising GDP growth expectations to 6.8%; despite a dovish tone, it chose not to cut rates 
immediately, allowing time for earlier easing measures to take full effect, while also introducing 
regulatory steps to support credit growth.
•
Bond yields rose due to concerns over increased supply, particularly in state development loans 
(SDLs), and fiscal risks linked to GST redesign, with INR depreciation adding to expectations of 
future rate hikes; stretched investor positioning suggests that supportive actions like OMOs or 
auction calendar changes could help ease yields.
•
The bond market is expected to remain in a consolidation phase, with limited room for further 
easing making carry-focused strategies more attractive than duration plays; the 10-year yield is 
likely to trade between 6.20%–6.70%, while 1–5-year yield curve offer better risk-reward, and 
the medium-term outlook remains stable, depending on inflation, fiscal signals, and global 
factors.
•
We remain constructive on the short to medium end of the yield curve. Short Duration 
funds, Banking & PSU Debt funds, Corporate Bond funds, Medium Duration funds, 
Money Market funds, Low Duration funds and Ultra Short Duration funds can be 
considered by investors with an investment horizon commensurate with the maturity profile of 
the schemes. Investors can consider investing in Medium Duration as per their risk appetite 
with an investment horizon of at least 2-3 years to avoid any intermittent volatility.
FOMC minutes highlight divergence among officials
▪Most policymakers backed the recent 25bps cut and signaled further easing ahead, a minority 
urged caution over persistent inflation risks.
Export gained momentum led by electronics and minerals
▪Exports growth was strong driven by electronics, cereals, minerals, tea. Service export 
contribution was strong.
