There are leaders and there are those who lead. Leaders 
hold a position of power or influence. Those who lead 
inspire us. 
Whether individuals or organizations, we follow those who lead 
not because we have to, but because we want to. We follow those 
who lead not for them, but for ourselves. 
This is a book for those who want to inspire others and for those 
who want to find someone to inspire them.

INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION
INTRODUCTION 
WHY START WITH WHY? 
This book is about a naturally occurring pattern, a way of thinking, 
acting and communicating that gives some leaders the ability to 
inspire those around them. Although these "natural-born leaders" 
may have come into the world with a predisposition to inspire, the 
ability is not reserved for them exclusively. We can all learn this 
pattern. With a little discipline, any leader or organization can in-
spire others, both inside and outside their organization, to help 
advance their ideas and their vision. We can all learn to lead. 
The goal of this book is not simply to try to fix the things that 
aren't working. Rather, I wrote this book as a guide to focus on and 
amplify the things that do work. I do not aim to upset the solutions 
offered by others. Most of the answers we get, when based on sound 
evidence, are perfectly valid. However, if we're starting with the 
wrong questions, if we don't understand the cause, then even the 
right answers will always steer us wrong ... eventually. The truth, 
you see, is always revealed... eventually. 
The stories that follow are of those individuals and organizations 
that naturally embody this pattern. They are the ones that start with 
Why.

The goal was ambitious. Public interest was high. Experts were 
eager to contribute. Money was readily available. 
Armed with every ingredient for success, Samuel Pierpont 
Langley set out in the early 1900s to be the first man to pilot an 
airplane. Highly regarded, he was a senior officer at the Smithso-
nian Institution, a mathematics professor who had also worked at 
Harvard. His friends included some of the most powerful men in 
government and business, including Andrew Carnegie and Alexan-
der Graham Bell. Langley was given a $50,000 grant from the War 
Department to fund his project, a tremendous amount of money for 
the time. He pulled together the best minds of the day, a veritable 
dream team of talent and know-how. Langley and his team used the 
finest materials, and the press followed him everywhere. People all 
over the country were riveted to the story, waiting to read that he 
had achieved his goal. With the team he had gathered and ample 
resources, his success was guaranteed. 
Or was it? 
A few hundred miles away, Wilbur and Orville Wright were 
working on their own flying machine. Their passion to fly was so 
intense that it inspired the enthusiasm and commitment of a ded-
icated group in their hometown of Dayton, Ohio. There was no 
funding for their venture. No government grants. No high-level 
connections. Not a single person on the team had an advanced 
degree or even a college education, not even Wilbur or Orville. But 
the team banded together in a humble bicycle shop and made their 
vision real. On December 17, 1903, a small group witnessed a man 
take flight for the first time in history. 
How did the Wright brothers succeed where a better-equipped, 
better-funded and better-educated team could not?

It wasn't luck. Both the Wright brothers and Langley were highly 
motivated. Both had a strong work ethic. Both had keen scientific 
minds. They were pursuing exactly the same goal, but only the 
Wright brothers were able to inspire those around them and truly 
lead their team to develop a technology that would change the 
world. Only the Wright brothers started with Why. 
2. 
In 1965, students on the campus of the University of California, 
Berkeley, were the first to publicly burn their draft cards to protest 
America's involvement in the Vietnam War. Northern California 
was a hotbed of antigovernment and antiestablishment sentiment; 
footage of clashes and riots in Berkeley and Oakland was beamed 
around the globe, fueling sympathetic movements across the United 
States and Europe. But it wasn't until 1976, nearly three years after 
the end of America's military involvement in the Vietnam conflict, 
that a different revolution ignited. 
They aimed to make an impact, a very big impact, even chal-
lenge the way people perceived how the world worked. But these 
young revolutionaries did not throw stones or take up arms against 
an authoritarian regime. Instead, they decided to beat the system at 
its own game. For Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, the cofounders of 
Apple Computer, the battlefield was business and the weapon of 
choice was the personal computer. 
The personal computer revolution was beginning to brew when 
Wozniak built the Apple I. Just starting to gain attention, the tech-
nology was primarily seen as a tool for business. Computers were 
too complicated and out of the price range of the average individ-
ual. But Wozniak, a man not motivated by money, envisioned a 
nobler purpose for the technology. He saw the personal computer 
as a way for the little man to take on a corporation. If he could 


--- Page 11 ---

4 
figure out a way to get it in the hands of the individual, he thought, 
the computer would give nearly anyone the ability to perform many 
of the same functions as a vastly better resourced company. The 
personal computer could level the playing field and change the way 
the world operated. Woz designed the Apple I, and improved the 
technology with the Apple II, to be affordable and simple to use. 
No matter how visionary or how brilliant, a great idea or a great 
product isn't worth much if no one buys it. Wozniak's best friend at 
the time, the twenty-one-year-old Steve Jobs, knew exactly what to 
do. Though he had experience selling surplus electronics parts, Jobs 
would prove to be much more than a good salesman. He wanted to 
do something significant in the world, and building a company was 
how he was going to do it. Apple was the tool he used to ignite his 
revolution. 
In their first year in business, with only one product, Apple 
made a million dollars in revenues. By year two, they did $10 mil-
lion in sales. In their fourth year they sold $100 million worth of 
computers. And in just six years, Apple Computer was a billion- 
dollar company with over 3,000 employees. 
Jobs and Woz were not the only people taking part in the per-
sonal computer revolution. They weren't the only smart guys in the 
business; in fact, they didn't know much about business at all. What 
made Apple special was not their ability to build such a fast-growth 
company. It wasn't their ability to think differently about personal 
computers. What has made Apple special is that they've been able to 
repeat the pattern over and over and over. Unlike any of their 
competitors, Apple has successfully challenged conventional think-
ing within the computer industry, the small electronics industry, the 
music industry, the mobile phone industry and the broader 
entertainment industry. And the reason is simple. Apple inspires. 
Apple starts with Why.

He was not perfect. He had his complexities. He was not the only 
one who suffered in a pre-civil rights America, and there were 
plenty of other charismatic speakers. But Martin Luther King Jr. had 
a gift. He knew how to inspire people. 
Dr. King knew that if the civil rights movement was to succeed, 
if there was to be a real, lasting change, it would take more than him 
and his closest allies. It would take more than rousing words and 
eloquent speeches. It would take people, tens of thousands of 
average citizens, united by a single vision, to change the country. At 
11:00 a.m. on August 28, 1963, they would send a message to Wash-
ington that it was time for America to steer a new course. 
The organizers of the civil rights movement did not send out 
thousands of invitations, nor was there a Web site to check the date. 
But the people came. And they kept coming and coming. All told, a 
quarter of a million people descended on the nation's capital in time 
to hear the words immortalized by history, delivered by the man 
who would lead a movement that would change America forever: "I 
have a dream." 
The ability to attract so many people from across the country, of 
all colors and races, to join together on the right day, at the right 
time, took something special. Though others knew what had to 
change in America to bring about civil rights for all, it was Martin 
Luther King who was able to inspire a country to change not just for 
the good of a minority, but for the good of everyone. Martin 
Luther King started with Why. 
.  .  . 
There are leaders and there are those who lead. With only 6 percent 
market share in the United States and about 3 percent worldwide, 
Apple is not a leading manufacturer of home computers. Yet the 
company leads the computer industry and is now a leader in other

6 
industries as well. Martin Luther King's experiences were not 
unique, yet he inspired a nation to change. The Wright brothers 
were not the strongest contenders in the race to take the first 
manned, powered flight, but they led us into a new era of aviation 
and, in doing so, completely changed the world we live in. 
Their goals were not different than anyone else's, and their sys-
tems and processes were easily replicated. Yet the Wright brothers, 
Apple and Martin Luther King stand out among their peers. They 
stand apart from the norm and their impact is not easily copied. 
They are members of a very select group of leaders who do some-
thing very, very special. They inspire us. 
Just about every person or organization needs to motivate others 
to act for some reason or another. Some want to motivate a purchase 
decision. Others are looking for support or a vote. Still others are 
keen to motivate the people around them to work harder or smarter 
or just follow the rules. The ability to motivate people is not, in 
itself, difficult. It is usually tied to some external factor. Tempting 
incentives or the threat of punishment will often elicit the behavior 
we desire. General Motors, for example, so successfully motivated 
people to buy their products that they sold more cars than any other 
automaker in the world for over seventy- seven years. Though they 
were leaders in their industry, they did not lead. 
Great leaders, in contrast, are able to inspire people to act. Those 
who are able to inspire give people a sense of purpose or belonging 
that has little to do with any external incentive or benefit to be 
gained. Those who truly lead are able to create a following of people 
who act not because they were swayed, but because they were 
inspired. For those who are inspired, the motivation to act is deeply 
personal. They are less likely to be swayed by incentives. Those who 
are inspired are willing to pay a premium or endure inconvenience, 
even personal suffering. Those who are able to inspire will create a 
following of people—supporters, voters, customers, workers—who 


--- Page 14 ---
WHY STAR WITH WHY 
7 
act for the good of the whole not because they have to, but because 
they want to. 
Though relatively few in number, the organizations and leaders 
with the natural ability to inspire us come in all shapes and sizes. 
They can be found in both the public and private sectors. They are 
in all sorts of industries—selling to consumers or to other busi-
nesses. Regardless of where they exist, they all have a dispropor-
tionate amount of influence in their industries. They have the most 
loyal customers and the most loyal employees. They tend to be more 
profitable than others in their industry. They are more innovative, 
and most importantly, they are able to sustain all these things over 
the long term. Many of them change industries. Some of them even 
change the world. 
The Wright brothers, Apple and Dr. King are just three exam- 
pies. Harley-Davidson, Disney and Southwest Airlines are three 
more. John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were also able to inspire. 
No matter from where they hail, they all have something in 
common. All the inspiring leaders and companies, regardless of size 
or industry, think, act and communicate exactly alike. 
And it's the complete opposite of everyone else. 
What if we could all learn to think, act and communicate like 
those who inspire? I imagine a world in which the ability to inspire 
is practiced not just by a chosen few, but by the majority. Studies 
show that over 80 percent of Americans do not have their dream job. 
If more knew how to build organizations that inspire, we could live 
in a world in which that statistic was the reverse—a world in which 
over 80 percent of people loved their jobs. People who love going to 
work are more productive and more creative. They go home 
happier and have happier families. They treat their colleagues and 
clients and customers better. Inspired employees make for stronger 
companies and stronger economies. That is why I wrote this book. I 
hope to inspire others to do the things that inspire them so that

together we may build the companies, the economy and a world in 
which trust and loyalty are the norm and not the exception. This 
book is not designed to tell you what to do or how to do it. Its goal 
is not to give you a course of action. Its goal is to offer you the cause 
of action. 
For those who have an open mind for new ideas, who seek to 
create long-lasting success and who believe that your success re-
quires the aid of others, I offer you a challenge. From now on, start 
with Why.

ASSUME YOU KNOW 
On a cold January day, a forty-three-year-old man was 
sworn in as the chief executive of his country. By his side 
stood his predecessor, a famous general who, fifteen years 
earlier, had commanded his nation's armed forces in a war 
that resulted in the defeat of Germany. The young leader 
was raised in the Roman Catholic faith. He spent the next 
five hours watching parades in his honor and stayed up 
celebrating until three o'clock in the morning. 
You know who I'm describing, right? 
It's January 30, 1933, and I'm describing Adolf Hitler and not, as 
most people would assume, John F. Kennedy. 
The point is, we make assumptions. We make assumptions about 
the world around us based on sometimes incomplete or false 
information. In this case, the information I offered was incomplete. 
Many of you were convinced that I was describing John F. Kennedy 
until I added one minor little detail: the date. 
This is important because our behavior is affected by our as-
sumptions or our perceived truths. We make decisions based on 
what we think we know. It wasn't too long ago that the majority of 


--- Page 19 ---
START WITH WHY 
12 
people believed the world was flat. This perceived truth impacted 
behavior. During this period, there was very little exploration. Peo-
ple feared that if they traveled too far they might fall off the edge of 
the earth. So for the most part they stayed put. It wasn't until that 
minor detail was revealed—the world is round—that behaviors 
changed on a massive scale. Upon this discovery, societies began to 
traverse the planet. Trade routes were established; spices were 
traded. New ideas, like mathematics, were shared between societies 
which unleashed all kinds of innovations and advancements. The 
correction of a simple false assumption moved the human race 
forward. 
Now consider how organizations are formed and how decisions 
are made. Do we really know why some organizations succeed and 
why others don't, or do we just assume? No matter your definition 
of success—hitting a target stock price, making a certain amount of 
money, meeting a revenue or profit goal, getting a big promotion, 
starting your own company, feeding the poor, winning public 
office—how we go about achieving our goals is very similar. Some 
of us just wing it, but most of us try to at least gather some data so 
we can make educated decisions. Sometimes this gathering process 
is formal—like conducting polls or market research. And sometimes 
it's informal, like asking our friends and colleagues for advice or 
looking back on our own personal experience to provide some 
perspective. Regardless of the process or the goals, we all want to 
make educated decisions. More importantly, we all want to make 
the right decisions. 
As we all know, however, not all decisions work out to be the 
right ones, regardless of the amount of data we collect. Sometimes 
the impact of those wrong decisions is minor, and sometimes it can 
be catastrophic. Whatever the result, we make decisions based on a 
perception of the world that may not, in fact, be completely accu-
rate. Just as so many were certain that I was describing John F. 


--- Page 20 ---
ASSUME YOU KNOW 
 
13 
Kennedy at the beginning of this section. You were certain you were 
right. You might even have bet money on it—a behavior based on 
an assumption. Certain, that is, until I offered that little detail of the 
date. 
Not only bad decisions are made on false assumptions. Some-
times when things go right, we think we know why, but do we re-
ally? That the result went the way you wanted does not mean you 
can repeat it over and over. I have a friend who invests some of his 
own money. Whenever he does well, it's because of his brains and 
ability to pick the right stocks, at least according to him. But when 
he loses money, he always blames the market. I have no issue with 
either line of logic, but either his success and failure hinge upon his 
own prescience and blindness or they hinge upon good and bad 
luck. But it can't be both. 
So how can we ensure that all our decisions will yield the best 
results for reasons that are fully within our control? Logic dictates 
that more information and data are key. And that's exactly what we 
do. We read books, attend conferences, listen to podcasts and ask 
friends and colleagues—all with the purpose of finding out more so 
we can figure out what to do or how to act. The problem is, we've all 
been in situations in which we have all the data and get lots of good 
advice but things still don't go quite right. Or maybe the impact 
lasted for only a short time, or something happened that we could 
not foresee. A quick note to all of you who correctly guessed Adolf 
Hitler at the beginning of the section: the details I gave are the same 
for both Hitler and John F. Kennedy, it could have been either. You 
have to be careful what you think you know. Asumptions, you see, 
even when based on sound research, can lead us astray. 
Intuitively we understand this. We understand that even with 
mountains of data and good advice, if things don't go as expected, 
it's probably because we missed one, sometimes small but vital de-
tail. In these cases, we go back to all our sources, maybe seek out 


--- Page 21 ---
START WITH WHY 
14 
some new ones, and try to figure out what to do, and the whole 
process begins again. More data, however, doesn't always help, es-
pecially if a flawed assumption set the whole process in motion in 
the first place. There are other factors that must be considered, fac-
tors that exist outside of our rational, analytical, information- 
hungry brains. 
There are times in which we had no data or we chose to ignore 
the advice or information at hand and just went with our gut and 
things worked out just fine, sometimes even better than expected. 
This dance between gut and rational decision-making pretty much 
covers how we conduct business and even live our lives. We can 
continue to slice and dice all the options in every direction, but at 
the end of all the good advice and all the compelling evidence, 
we're left where we started: how to explain or decide a course of 
action that yields a desired effect that is repeatable. How can we 
have 20/20 foresight? 
There is a wonderful story of a group of American car executives 
who went to Japan to see a Japanese assembly line. At the end of the 
line, the doors were put on the hinges, the same as in America. But 
something was missing. In the United States, a line worker would 
take a rubber mallet and tap the edges of the door to ensure that it 
fit perfectly. In Japan, that job didn't seem to exist. Confused, the 
American auto executives asked at what point they made sure the 
door fit perfectly. Their Japanese guide looked at them and smiled 
sheepishly. "We make sure it fits when we design it." In the 
Japanese auto plant, they didn't examine the problem and 
accumulate data to figure out the best solution—they engineered 
the outcome they wanted from the beginning. If they didn't achieve 
their desired outcome, they understood it was because of a decision 
they made at the start of the process. 
At the end of the day, the doors on the American-made and 
Japanese-made cars appeared to fit when each rolled off the as-


--- Page 22 ---
ASSUME YOU KNOW 
 
15 
sembly line. Except the Japanese didn't need to employ someone to 
hammer doors, nor did they need to buy any mallets. More impor-
tantly, the Japanese doors are likely to last longer and maybe even 
be more structurally sound in an accident. All this for no other 
reason than they ensured the pieces fit from the start. 
What the American automakers did with their rubber mallets is 
a metaphor for how so many people and organizations lead. When 
faced with a result that doesn't go according to plan, a series of 
perfectly effective short-term tactics are used until the desired out- 
come is achieved. But how structurally sound are those solutions? 
So many organizations function in a world of tangible goals and the 
mallets to achieve them. The ones that achieve more, the ones that 
get more out of fewer people and fewer resources, the ones with an 
outsized amount of influence, however, build products and com-
panies and even recruit people that all fit based on the original 
intention. Even though the outcome may look the same, great lead-
ers understand the value in the things we cannot see. 
Every instruction we give, every course of action we set, every 
result we desire, starts with the same thing: a decision. There are 
those who decide to manipulate the door to fit to achieve the desired 
result and there are those who start from somewhere very different. 
Though both courses of action may yield similar short- term results, 
it is what we can't see that makes long-term success more 
predictable for only one. The one that understood why the doors 
need to fit by design and not by default.

CARROTS AND STICKS 
Manipulation vs. Inspiration 
There's barely a product or service on the market today that cus-
tomers can't buy from someone else for about the same price, about 
the same quality, about the same level of service and about the same 
features. If you truly have a first-mover's advantage, it's probably 
lost in a matter of months. If you offer something truly novel, 
someone else will soon come up with something similar and maybe 
even better. 
But if you ask most businesses why their customers are their 
customers, most will tell you it's because of superior quality, fea-
tures, price or service. In other words, most companies have no clue 
why their customers are their customers. This is a fascinating 
realization. If companies don't know why their customers are their 
customers, odds are good that they don't know why their employees 
are their employees either. 
If most companies don't really know why their customers are 
their customers or why their employees are their employees, then 


--- Page 25 ---

18 
how do they know how to attract more employees and encourage 
loyalty among those they already have? The reality is, most busi-
nesses today are making decisions based on a set of incomplete or, 
worse, completely flawed assumptions about what's driving their 
business. 
There are only two ways to influence human behavior: you can 
manipulate it or you can inspire it. When I mention manipulation, 
this is not necessarily pejorative; it's a very common and fairly be-
nign tactic. In fact, many of us have been doing it since we were 
young. "I'll be your best friend" is the highly effective negotiating 
tactic employed by generations of children to obtain something they 
want from a peer. And as any child who has ever handed over 
candy hoping for a new best friend will tell you, it works. 
From business to politics, manipulations run rampant in all 
forms of sales and marketing. Typical manipulations include: drop-
ping the price; running a promotion; using fear, peer pressure or 
aspirational messages; and promising innovation to influence 
behavior—be it a purchase, a vote or support. When companies or 
organizations do not have a clear sense of why their customers are 
their customers, they tend to rely on a disproportionate number of 
manipulations to get what they need. And for good reason. Ma-
nipulations work. 
Price 
Many companies are reluctant to play the price game, but they do 
so because they know it is effective. So effective, in fact, that the 
temptation can sometimes be overwhelming. There are few profes-
sional services firms that, when faced with an opportunity to land a 
big piece of business, haven't just dropped their price to make the 
deal happen. No matter how they rationalized it to themselves or 
their clients, price is a highly effective manipulation. Drop your 
prices low enough and people will buy from you. We see it at the

end of a retail season when products are "priced to move." Drop the 
price low enough and the shelves will very quickly clear to make 
room for the next season's products. 
Playing the price game, however, can come at tremendous cost 
and can create a significant dilemma for the company. For the seller, 
selling based on price is like heroin. The short-term gain is fantastic, 
but the more you do it, the harder it becomes to kick the habit. Once 
buyers get used to paying a lower-than-average price for a product 
or service, it is very hard to get them to pay more. And the sellers, 
facing overwhelming pressure to push prices lower and lower in 
order to compete, find their margins cut slimmer and slimmer. This 
only drives a need to sell more to compensate. And the quickest 
way to do that is price again. And so the downward spiral of price 
addiction sets in. In the drug world, these addicts are called junkies. 
In the business world, we call them commodities. Insurance. Home 
computers. Mobile phone service. Any number of packaged goods. 
The list of commodities created by the price game goes on and on. 
In nearly every circumstance, the companies that are forced to treat 
their products as commodities brought it upon themselves. I cannot 
debate that dropping the price is not a perfectly legitimate way of 
driving business; the challenge is staying profitable. 
Wal-Mart seems to be an exception to the rule. They have built a 
phenomenally successful business playing the price game. But it 
also came at a high cost. Scale helped Wal-Mart avoid the inherent 
weaknesses of a price strategy, but the company's obsession with 
price above all else has left it scandal-ridden and hurt its reputation. 
And every one of the company's scandals was born from its 
attempts to keep costs down so it could afford to offer such low 
prices. 
Price always costs something. The question is, how much are 
you willing to pay for the money you make?

Promotions 
General Motors had a bold goal. To lead the American automotive 
industry in market share. In the 1950s there were four choices of car 
manufacturer in the United States: GM, Ford, Chrysler and AMC. 
Before foreign automakers entered the field, GM dominated. New 
competition, as one would expect, made that goal harder to 
maintain. I don't need to provide any data to explain how much has 
changed in the auto industry in fifty years. But General Motors held 
fast through most of the last century and maintained its prized 
dominance. 
Since 1990, however, Toyota's share of the U.S. market has more 
than doubled. By 2007, Toyota's share had climbed to 16.3 percent, 
from only 7.8 percent. During the same period, GM saw its U.S. 
market share drop dramatically from 35 percent in 1990 to 23.8 
percent in 2007. And in early 2008, the unthinkable happened: U.S. 
consumers bought more foreign-made automobiles than ones made 
in America. 
Since the 1990s, faced with this onslaught of competition from 
Japan, GM and the other U.S. automakers have scrambled to offer 
incentives aimed at helping them hold on to their dwindling share. 
Heavily promoted with advertising, GM, for one, has offered cash- 
back incentives of between $500 and $7,000 to customers who 
bought their cars and trucks. For a long time the promotions 
worked brilliantly. GM's sales were on the rise again. 
But in the long term the incentives only helped to dramatically 
erode GM's profit margins and put them in a deep hole. In 2007, 
GM lost $729 per vehicle, in large part due to incentives. Realizing 
that the model was unsustainable, GM announced it would reduce 
the amount of the cash-back incentives it offered, and with that 
reduction, sales plummeted. No cash, no customers. The auto in-
dustry had effectively created cash-back junkies out of customers, 
building an expectation that there's no such thing as full price.

Whether it is "two for one" or "free toy inside," promotions are 
such common manipulations that we often forget that we're being 
manipulated in the first place. Next time you're in the market for a 
digital camera, for example, pay attention to how you make your 
decision. You'll easily find two or three cameras with the spec-
ifications you need—size, number of megapixels, comparable price, 
good brand name. But perhaps one has a promotion—a free 
carrying case or free memory card. Given the relative parity of the 
features and benefits, that little something extra is sometimes all it 
takes to tip the scale. In the business-to-business world, pro- 
motions are called "value added." But the principles are the same— 
give something away for free to reduce the risk so that someone will 
do business with you. And like price, promotions work. 
The manipulative nature of promotions is so well established in 
retail that the industry even named one of the principles. They call it 
breakage. Breakage measures the percentage of customers who fail 
to take advantage of a promotion and end up paying full price for a 
product instead. This typically happens when buyers don't bother 
performing the necessary steps to claim their rebates, a process pur-
posely kept complicated or inconvenient to increase the likelihood 
of mistakes or inaction to keep that breakage number up. 
Rebates typically require the customer to send in a copy of a 
receipt, cut out a bar code from the packaging and painstakingly fill 
out a rebate form with details about the product and how it was 
purchased. Sending in the wrong part of the box or leaving out a 
detail on the application can delay the rebate for weeks, months, or 
void it altogether. The rebate industry also has a name for the num-
ber of customers who just don't bother to apply for the rebate, or 
who never cash the rebate check they receive. That's called slippage. 
For businesses, the short-term benefits of rebates and other ma-
nipulations are clear: a rebate lures customers to pay full price for a 
product that they may have considered buying only because of the 


--- Page 29 ---
START WITH WHY 
22 
prospect of a partial refund. But nearly 40 percent of those custom-
ers never get the lower price they thought they were paying. Call it 
a tax on the disorganized, but retailers rely on it. 
Regulators have stepped up their scrutiny of the rebate industry, 
but with only limited success. The rebate process remains cumber-
some and that means free money for the seller. Manipulation at its 
best. But at what cost? 
Fear 
If someone were to hold up a bank with a banana in his pocket, he 
would be charged with armed robbery. Clearly, no victim was in 
any danger of being shot, but it is the belief that the robber has a 
real gun that is considered by the law. And for good reason. 
Knowing full well that fear will motivate them to comply with his 
demands, the robber took steps to make his victims afraid. Fear, real 
or perceived, is arguably the most powerful manipulation of the lot. 
"No one ever got fired for hiring IBM," goes the old adage, de-
scribing a behavior completely borne out of fear. An employee in a 
procurement department, tasked with finding the best suppliers for 
a company, turns down a better product at a better price simply 
because it is from a smaller company or lesser-known brand. Fear, 
real or perceived, that his job would be on the line if something 
went wrong was enough to make him ignore the express purpose of 
his job, even do something that was not in the company's best 
interest. 
When fear is employed, facts are incidental. Deeply seated in our 
biological drive to survive, that emotion cannot be quickly wiped 
away with facts and figures. This is how terrorism works. It's not 
the statistical probability that one could get hurt by a terrorist, but 
it's the fear that it might happen that cripples a population. 
A powerful manipulator, fear is often used with far less nefari-
ous motivations. We use fear to raise our kids. We use fear to mo-


--- Page 30 ---
CARROTS AND STICKS 
23 
tivate people to obey a code of ethics. Fear is regularly used in 
public service ads, say to promote child safety or AIDS awareness, 
or the need to wear seat belts. Anyone who was watching television 
in the 1980s got a heavy dose of antidrug advertising, including one 
often-mimicked public service ad from a federal program to combat 
drug abuse among teenagers: "This is your brain," the man's voice 
said as he held up a pristine white egg. Then he cracked the egg into 
a frying pan of spattering hot oil. "This is your brain on drug. Any 
questions?" 
And another ad intended to scare the hell out of any brash teen-
ager: "Cocaine doesn't make you sexy... it makes you dead." 
Likewise, when politicians say that their opponent will raise 
taxes or cut spending on law enforcement, or the evening news 
alerts you that your health or security are at risk unless you tune in 
at eleven, both are attempting to seed fear among voters and view-
ers, respectively. Businesses also use fear to agitate the insecurity 
we all have in order to sell products. The idea is that if you don't 
buy the product or service, something bad could happen to you. 
"Every thirty-six seconds, someone dies of a heart attack," states 
an ad for a local cardiac specialist. "Do you have radon? Your neigh-
bor does!" reads the ad on the side of a truck for some company 
selling a home-pollution-inspection service. And, of course, the 
insurance industry would like to sell you term life insurance "before 
it's too late." 
If anyone has ever sold you anything with a warning to fear the 
consequences if you don't buy it, they are using a proverbial gun to 
your head to help you see the "value" of choosing them over their 
competitor. Or perhaps it's just a banana. But it works. 
Aspirations 
"Quitting smoking is the easiest thing I've ever done," said Mark 
Twain. "I've done it hundreds of times." 


--- Page 31 ---
START WITH WHY 
24 
If fear motivates us to move away from something horrible, 
aspirational messages tempt us toward something desirable. 
Marketers often talk about the importance of being aspirational, 
offering someone something they desire to achieve and the ability to 
get there more easily with a particular product or service. "Six steps 
to a happier life." "Work those abs to your dream dress size!" "In six 
short weeks you can be rich." All these messages manipulate. They 
tempt us with the things we want to have or to be the person we 
wish we were. 
Though positive in nature, aspirational messages are most ef-
fective with those who lack discipline or have a nagging fear or 
insecurity that they don't have the ability to achieve their dreams on 
their own (which, at various times for various reasons, is everyone). 
I always joke that you can get someone to buy a gym membership 
with an aspirational message, but to get them to go three days a 
week requires a bit of inspiration. Someone who lives a healthy 
lifestyle and is in a habit of exercising does not respond to "six easy 
steps to losing weight." It's those who don't have the lifestyle that 
are most susceptible. It's not news that a lot of people try diet after 
diet after diet in an attempt to get the body of their dreams. And no 
matter the regime they choose, each comes with the qualification 
that regular exercise and a balanced diet will help boost results. In 
other words, discipline. Gym memberships tend to rise about 12 
percent every January, as people try to fulfill their New Year's 
aspiration to live a healthier life. Yet only a fraction of those 
aspiring fitness buffs are still attending the gym by the end of the 
year. Aspirational messages can spur behavior, but for most, it 
won't last. 
Aspirational messages are not only effective in the consumer 
market, they also work quite well in business-to-business transac-
tions. Managers of companies, big and small, all want to do well, so 
they make decisions, hire consultants and implement systems to 


--- Page 32 ---
CARROTS AND STICKS 
25 
help them achieve that desired outcome. But all too often, it is not 
the systems that fail but the ability to maintain them. I can speak 
from personal experience here. I've implemented a lot of systems or 
practices over the years to help me "achieve the success to which I 
aspire," only to find myself back to my old habits two weeks later. I 
aspire for a system that will help me avoid implementing systems to 
meet all my aspirations. But I probably wouldn't be able to follow it 
for very long. 
This short-term response to long-term desires is alive and well in 
the corporate world also. A management consultant friend of mine 
was hired by a billion-dollar company to help it fulfill its goals and 
aspirations. The problem was, she explained, no matter the issue, 
the company's managers were always drawn to the quicker, cheaper 
option over the better long-term solution. Just like the habitual 
dieter, "they never have the time or money to do it right the first 
time," she said of her client, "but they always have the time and 
money to do it again." 
Peer Pressure 
"Four out of five dentists prefer Trident," touts the chewing gum 
advertisement in an attempt to get you to try their product. "A 
double-blind study conducted at a top university concluded . . ." 
pushes a late-night infomercial. "If the product is good enough for 
professionals, it's good enough for you," the advertising eggs on. 
"With over a million satisfied customers and counting," teases an-
other ad. These are all forms of peer pressure. When marketers 
report that a majority of a population or a group of experts prefers 
their product over another, they are attempting to sway the buyer to 
believing that whatever they are selling is better. The peer pressure 
works because we believe that the majority or the experts might 
know more than we do. Peer pressure works not because the 
majority or the experts are always right, but because we fear that we 
may be wrong.

Celebrity endorsements are sometimes used to add peer pressure 
to the sales pitch. "If he uses it," we're supposed to think, "it must be 
good." This makes sense when we hear Tiger Woods endorse Nike 
golf products or Titleist golf balls. (Woods's deal with Nike is 
actually credited for putting the company on the map in the golf 
world.) But Tiger has also endorsed General Motors cars, man-
agement consulting services, credit cards, food and a Tag Heuer 
watch designed "especially for the golfer." The watch, incidentally, 
can withstand a 5,000-g shock, a level of shock more likely experi-
enced by the golf ball than the golfer. But Tiger endorsed it, so it 
must be good. Celebrity endorsements are also used to appeal to our 
aspirations and our desires to be like them. The most explicit 
example was Gatorade's "I wanna be like Mike" campaign, which 
tempted youngsters to grow up and be just like Michael Jordan if 
they drink Gatorade. With many other examples of celebrity en-
dorsements, however, it is harder to see the connection. Sam Water- 
ston of Law & Order fame, for example, sells online trading from TD 
Ameritrade. But for his celebrity, it's uncertain what an actor famed 
for convicting homicidal maniacs does for the brand. I guess he's 
"trustworthy." 
Impressionable youth are not the only ones subject to peer 
pressure. Most of us have probably had an experience of being 
pressured by a salesman. Have you ever had a sales rep try to sell 
you some "office solution" by telling you that 70 percent of your 
competitors are using their service, so why aren't you? But what if 
70 percent of your competitors are idiots? Or what if that 70 percent 
were given so much value added or offered such a low price that 
they couldn't resist the opportunity? The practice is designed to do 
one thing and one thing only—to pressure you to buy. To make you 
feel you might be missing out on something or that everyone else 
knows but you. Better to go with the majority, right?

To quote my mother, "If your friends put their head in the oven, 
would you do that too?" Sadly, if Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods 
was paid to do just that, it might actually start a trend. 
Novelty (a.k.a. Innovation) 
"In a major innovation in design and engineering, [Motorola] has 
created a phone of firsts," read a 2004 press release that announced 
the launch of the mobile phone manufacturer's newest entry to the 
ultracompetitive mobile phone market. "The combination of metals, 
such as aircraft-grade aluminum, with new advances, such as an 
internal antenna and a chemically-etched keypad, led to the for-
mation of a device that measures just 13.9mm thin." 
And it worked. Millions of people rushed to get one. Celebrities 
flashed their RAZRs on the red carpet. Even a prime minister or two 
was seen talking on one. Having sold over 50 million units, few 
could argue that the RAZR wasn't a huge success. "By surpassing 
current mobile expectations, the RAZR represents Motorola's his-
tory of delivering revolutionary innovations," said former Motorola 
CEO Ed Zander of his new wunder-product, "while setting a new 
bar for future products coming out of the wireless industry." 
This one product was a huge financial success for Motorola. This 
was truly an innovation of monumental proportions. 
Or was it? 
Less than four years later, Zander was forced out. The stock 
traded at 50 percent of its average value since the launch of the 
RAZR, and Motorola's competitors had easily surpassed the RAZR's 
features and functionalities with equally innovative new phones. 
Motorola was once again rendered just another mobile phone 
manufacturer fighting for its piece of the pie. Like so many before it, 
the company confused innovation with novelty.

Real innovation changes the course of industries or even society. 
The light bulb, the microwave oven, the fax machine, iTunes. These 
are true innovations that changed how we conduct business, altered 
how we live our lives, and, in the case of iTunes, challenged an 
industry to completely reevaluate its business model. Adding a 
camera to a mobile phone, for example, is not an innovation— a 
great feature, for sure, but not industry-altering. With this revised 
definition in mind, even Motorola's own description of its new 
product becomes just a list of a few great features: a metal case, 
hidden antenna, flat keypad and a thin phone. Hardly "revolution-
ary innovation." Motorola had successfully designed the latest shiny 
object for people to get excited about ... at least until a new shiny 
object came out. And that's the reason these features are more a 
novelty than an innovation. They are added in an attempt to dif-
ferentiate, but not reinvent. It's not a bad thing, but it can't be 
counted on to add any long-term value. Novelty can drive sales— 
the RAZR proved it—but the impact does not last. If a company 
adds too many novel ideas too often, it can have a similar impact on 
the product or category as the price game. In an attempt to dif-
ferentiate with more features, the products start to look and feel 
more like commodities. And, like price, the need to add yet another 
product to the line to compensate for the commoditization ends in a 
downward spiral. 
In the 1970s, there were only two types of Colgate toothpaste. 
But as competition increased, Colgate's sales started to slip. So the 
company introduced a new product that included a new feature, the 
addition of fluoride, perhaps. Then another. Then another. Whit-
ening. Tartar control. Sparkles. Stripes. Each innovation certainly 
helped boost sales, for a while at least. And so the cycle continued. 
Guess how many different types of toothpaste Colgate has for you 
to choose from today? Thirty-two. Today there are thirty-two dif-
ferent types of Colgate toothpaste (excluding the four they make for 


--- Page 36 ---
CARROTS AND STICKS

kids). And given how each company responds to the "innovations" 
of the other, that means that Colgate's competitors also sell a similar 
number of variants that offer about the same quality, about the same 
benefits, at about the same price. There are literally dozens and 
dozens of toothpastes to choose from, yet there is no data to show 
that Americans are brushing their teeth more now than they were in 
the 1970s. Thanks to all this "innovation," it has become almost 
impossible to know which toothpaste is right for you. So much so 
that even Colgate offers a link on their Web site called "Need Help 
Deciding?" If Colgate needs to help us pick one of their products 
because there are too many variations, how are we supposed to 
decide when we go to the supermarket without their Web site to 
help us? 
Once again, this is an example of the newest set of shiny objects 
designed to encourage a trial or a purchase. What companies clev-
erly disguise as "innovation" is in fact novelty. And it's not only 
packaged goods that rely on novelty to lure customers; it's a com-
mon practice in other industries, too. It works, but rarely if ever 
does the strategy cement any loyal relationships. 
Apple's iPhone has since replaced the Motorola RAZR as the 
popular must-have new mobile phone. Removing all the buttons 
and putting a touch screen is not what makes the iPhone innovative, 
however. Those are brilliant new features. But others can copy those 
things and it wouldn't redefine the category. There is something 
else that Apple did that is vastly more significant. 
Apple is not only leading how mobile phones are designed, but, 
in typical Apple fashion, also how the industry functions. In the 
mobile phone industry, it is the service provider, not the phone 
manufacturer, that determines all the features and benefits the 
phone can offer. T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, AT&T all dic-
tate to Motorola, Nokia, Ericsson, LG and others what the phones 
will do. Then Apple showed up. They announced that they would 


--- Page 37 ---
START WITH WHY 
30 
tell the service provider what the phone would do, not the other 
way around. AT&T was the only one that agreed, thus earning the 
company the exclusive deal to offer the new technology. That's the 
kind of shift that will impact the industry for many years and will 
extend far beyond a few years of stock boost for the shiny new 
product. 
Novel, huh? 
The Price You Pay for the Money You Make 
I cannot dispute that manipulations work. Every one of them can 
indeed help influence behavior and every one of them can help a 
company become quite successful. But there are trade-offs. Not a 
single one of them breeds loyalty. Over the course of time, they cost 
more and more. The gains are only short-term. And they increase 
the level of stress for both the buyer and the seller. If you have ex-
ceptionally deep pockets or are looking to achieve only a short- 
term gain with no consideration for the long term, then these 
strategies and tactics are perfect. 
Beyond the business world, manipulations are the norm in pol-
itics today as well. Just as manipulations can drive a sale but not 
create loyalty, so too can they help a candidate get elected, but they 
don't create a foundation for leadership. Leadership requires people 
to stick with you through thick and thin. Leadership is the ability to 
rally people not for a single event, but for years. In business, 
leadership means that customers will continue to support your 
company even when you slip up. If manipulation is the only strat-
egy, what happens the next time a purchase decision is required? 
What happens after the election is won? 
There is a big difference between repeat business and loyalty. 
Repeat business is when people do business with you multiple 
times. Loyalty is when people are willing to turn down a better 
product or a better price to continue doing business with you. Loyal 


--- Page 38 ---
CARROTS AND STICKS 
31 
customers often don't even bother to research the competition or 
entertain other options. Loyalty is not easily won. Repeat business, 
however, is. All it takes is more manipulations. 
Manipulative techniques have become such a mainstay in 
American business today that it has become virtually impossible for 
some to kick the habit. Like any addiction, the drive is not to get 
sober, but to find the next fix faster and more frequently. And as 
good as the short-term highs may feel, they have a deleterious im-
pact on the long-term health of an organization. Addicted to the 
short-term results, business today has largely become a series of 
quick fixes added on one after another after another. The short- 
term tactics have become so sophisticated that an entire economy 
has developed to service the manipulations, equipped with statistics 
and quasi-science. Direct marketing companies, for example, offer 
calculations about which words will get the best results on each 
piece of direct mail they send out. 
Those that offer mail-in rebates know the incentive works and 
they know that the higher the rebate, the more effective it is. They 
also know the cost that goes along with those rebates. To make 
them profitable, manufacturers rely on the breakage and slippage 
numbers staying above a certain threshold. Just like our trusty drug 
addict, whose behavior is reinforced by how good the short-term 
high feels, the temptation to make the qualifications of the rebate 
more obscure or cumbersome so as to reduce the number of qual-
ified applicants can be overwhelming for some. 
Samsung, the electronics giant, mastered the art of the kind of 
fine print that makes rebates so profitable for companies. In the 
early 2000s, the company offered rebates up to $150 on a variety of 
electronic products, stipulating in the fine print that the rebate was 
limited to one per address—a requirement that would have 
sounded reasonable enough to anyone at the time. Yet in practice, it 
effectively disqualified all customers who lived in apartment 


--- Page 39 ---
START WITH WHY 
32 
buildings where more than one resident had applied for the same 
rebate. More than 4,000 Samsung customers lured by the cash back 
received notices denying them rebates on those grounds. The prac-
tice was brought to the attention of the New York attorney general, 
and in 2004 Samsung was ordered to pay $200,000 in rebate claims 
to apartment dwellers. This is an extreme case of a company that 
got caught. But the rebate game of cutting out UPC symbols, filling 
out forms and doing it all before the deadline is alive and well. How 
can a company claim to be customer-focused when they are so 
comfortable measuring the number of customers who will fail to 
realize any promise of savings? 
Manipulations Lead to Transactions, Not Loyalty 
"It's simple," explains the TV infomercial, "simply put your old gold 
jewelry in the prepaid, insured envelope and we'll send you a check 
for the value of the gold in just two days." Mygoldenvelope .com is 
one of the leaders in this industry, serving as a broker for gold to be 
sent to a refinery, melted down, and reintroduced into the 
commodity market. 
When Douglas Feirstein and Michael Moran started the com-
pany, they wanted to be the best in the business. They wanted to 
transform an industry with the reputation of a back-alley pawn 
shop and give it a bit of a Tiffany's sheen. They invested money in 
making the experience perfect. They worked to make the customer 
service experience ideal. They were both successful entrepreneurs 
and knew the value of building a brand and a strong customer 
experience. They'd spent a lot of money trying to get the balance 
right, and they made sure to explain their difference in direct re-
sponse advertising on various local and national cable stations. 
"Better than the similar offers," they'd say. And they were right. But 
the investment didn't pay off as expected. 


--- Page 40 ---
CARROTS AND STICKS 
33 
A few months later, Feirstein and Moran made a significant dis-
covery: almost all of their customers did business with them only 
once. They had a transactional business yet they were trying to 
make it so much more than that. So they stopped trying to make 
their service "better than similar offers," and instead settled with 
good. Given that most people were not going to become repeat 
customers, there weren't going to be any head-to-head comparisons 
made to the other services. All they needed to do was drive a 
purchase decision and offer a pleasant enough experience that 
people would recommend it to a friend. Any more was unneces-
sary. Once the owners of mygoldenvelope.com realized they didn't 
need to invest in the things that build loyalty if all they wanted to 
do was drive transactions, their business became vastly more effi-
cient and more profitable. 
For transactions that occur an average of once, carrots and sticks 
are the best way to elicit the desired behavior. When the police offer 
a reward they are not looking to nurture a relationship with the 
witness or tipster; it is just a single transaction. When you lose your 
kitten and offer a reward to get it back, you don't need to have a 
lasting relationship with the person returning it; you just want your 
cat back. 
Manipulations are a perfectly valid strategy for driving a trans-
action, or for any behavior that is only required once or on rare 
occasions. The rewards the police use are designed to incentivize 
witnesses to come forward to provide tips or evidence that may 
lead to an arrest. And, like any promotion, the manipulation will 
work if the incentive feels high enough to mitigate the risk. 
In any circumstance in which a person or organization wants 
more than a single transaction, however, if there is a hope for a 
loyal, lasting relationship, manipulations do not help. Does a poli-
tician want your vote, for example, or does he or she want a lifetime 
of support and loyalty from you? (Judging by how elections are run

these days, it seems all they want is to win elections. Ads discredit-
ing opponents, a focus on single issues, and an uncomfortable reli-
ance on fear or aspirational desires are all indicators. Those tactics 
win elections, but they do not seed loyalties among the voters.) 
The American car industry learned the hard way the high cost of 
relying on manipulations to build a business when loyalty was what 
they really needed to nurture. While manipulations may be a viable 
strategy when times are good and money is flush, a change in 
market conditions made them too expensive. When the oil crisis of 
2008 hit, the auto industry's promotions and incentives became 
untenable (the same thing happened in the 1970s). In this case, how 
long the manipulations could produce short-term gains was defined 
by the length of time the economy could sustain the strategy. This is 
a fundamentally weak platform upon which to build a business, an 
assumption of never-ending boom. Though loyal customers are less 
tempted by other offers and incentives, in good times the free flow 
of business makes it hard to recognize their value. It's in the tough 
times that loyal customers matter most. 
Manipulations work, but they cost money. Lots of money. When 
the money is not as available to fund those tactics, not having a loyal 
following really hurts. After September 11, there were customers 
who sent checks to Southwest Airlines to show their support. One 
note that accompanied a check for $1,000 read, "You've been so good 
to me over the years, in these hard times I wanted to say thank you 
by helping you out." The checks that Southwest Airlines received 
were certainly not enough to make any significant impact on the 
company's bottom line, but they were symbolic of the feeling 
customers had for the brand. They had a sense of partnership. The 
loyal behavior of those who didn't send money is almost impossible 
to measure, but its impact has been invaluable over the long term, 
helping Southwest to maintain its position as the most profitable 
airline in history.

Knowing you have a loyal customer and employee base not only 
reduces costs, it provides massive peace of mind. Like loyal friends, 
you know your customers and employees will be there for you 
when you need them most. It is the feeling of "we're in this 
together," shared between customer and company, voter and 
candidate, boss and employee, that defines great leaders. 
In contrast, relying on manipulations creates massive stress for 
buyer and seller alike. For the buyer, it has become increasingly 
difficult to know which product, service, brand or company is best. I 
joke about the proliferation of toothpaste varieties and the difficulty 
of choosing the right one. But toothpaste is just a metaphor. Nearly 
every decision we're asked to make every single day is like choosing 
toothpaste. Deciding what law firm to hire, college to attend, car to 
buy, company to work for, candidate to elect—there are just too 
many choices. All the advertising, promotions and pressure 
employed to tempt us one way or another, each attempting to push 
harder than the other to court us for our money or our support, 
ultimately yields one consistent result: stress. 
For the companies too, whose obligation it is to help us decide, 
their ability to do so has gotten more and more difficult. Every day, 
the competition is doing something new, something better. To con-
stantly have to come up with a new promotion, a new guerrilla 
marketing tactic, a new feature to add, is hard work. Combined 
with the long-term effects of years of short-term decisions that have 
eroded profit margins, this raises stress levels inside organizations 
as well. When manipulations are the norm, no one wins. 
It's not an accident that doing business today, and being in the 
workforce today, is more stressful than it used to be. Peter Why- 
brow, in his book American Mania: When More Is Not Enough, argues 
that many of the ills that we suffer from today have very little to do 
with the bad food we're eating or the partially hydrogenated oils in 
our diet. Rather, Whybrow says, it's the way that corporate America 


--- Page 43 ---
START WITH WHY 
36 
has developed that has increased our stress to levels so high we're 
literally making ourselves sick because of it. Americans are 
suffering ulcers, depression, high blood pressure, anxiety, and 
cancer at record levels. According to Whybrow, all those promises 
of more, more, more are actually overloading the reward circuits of 
our brain. The short-term gains that drive business in America 
today are actually destroying our health. 
Just Because It Works Doesn't Make It Right 
The danger of manipulations is that they work. And because ma-
nipulations work, they have become the norm, practiced by the vast 
majority of companies and organizations, regardless of size or 
industry. That fact alone creates a systemic peer pressure. With per-
fect irony, we, the manipulators, have been manipulated by our 
own system. With every price drop, promotion, fear-based or aspi-
rational message, and novelty we use to achieve our goals, we find 
our companies, our organizations and our systems getting weaker 
and weaker. 
The economic crisis that began in 2008 is just another, albeit 
extreme, example of what can happen if a flawed assumption is al-
lowed to carry on for too long. The collapse of the housing market 
and the subsequent collapse of the banking industry were due to 
decisions made inside the banks based on a series of manipulations. 
Employees were manipulated with bonuses that encouraged short-
sighted decision-making. Open shaming of anyone who spoke out 
discouraged responsible dissent. A free flow of loans encouraged 
aspiring homebuyers to buy more than they could afford at all price 
levels. There was very little loyalty. It was all a series of 
transactional decisions—effective, but at a high cost. Few were 
working for the good of the whole. Why would they?—there was no 
reason given to do so. There was no cause or belief beyond instant 
gratification. Bankers weren't the first to be swept up by their own 


--- Page 44 ---

37 
success. American car manufacturers have conducted themselves 
the same way for decades—manipulation after manipulation, short-
term decision built upon short-term decision. Buckling or even 
collapse is the only logical conclusion when manipulations are the 
main course of action. 
The reality is, in today's world, manipulations are the norm. 
But there is an alternative.

THE GOLDEN CIRCLE 
 
 
There are a few leaders who choose to inspire rather than manipu-
late in order to motivate people. Whether individuals or organiza-
tions, every single one of these inspiring leaders thinks, acts and 
communicates exactly the same way. And it's the complete opposite 
of the rest of us. Consciously or not, how they do it is by following a 
naturally occurring pattern that I call The Golden Circle. 
The concept of The Golden Circle was inspired by the golden 
ratio—a simple mathematical relationship that has fascinated 
mathematicians, biologists, architects, artists, musicians and 
naturists since the beginning of history. From the Egyptians to 
Pythagoras to Leonardo da Vinci, many have looked to the golden 
ratio to provide a mathematical formula for proportion and even 
beauty. It also supports the notion that there is more order in nature 


--- Page 49 ---
START WITH WHY 
42 
than we think, as in the symmetry of leaves and the geometric 
perfection of snowflakes. 
What I found so attractive about the golden ratio, however, was 
that it had so many applications in so many fields. And even more 
significantly, it offered a formula that could produce repeat- able 
and predictable results in places where such results might have 
been assumed to be a random occurrence or luck. Even Mother 
Nature—for most people a symbol of unpredictability—exhibited 
more order than we previously acknowledged. Like the golden 
ratio, which offers evidence of order in the seeming disorder of 
nature, The Golden Circle finds order and predictability in human 
behavior. Put simply, it helps us understand why we do what we 
do. The Golden Circle provides compelling evidence of how much 
more we can achieve if we remind ourselves to start everything we 
do by first asking why. 
The Golden Circle is an alternative perspective to existing 
assumptions about why some leaders and organizations have 
achieved such a disproportionate degree of influence. It offers clear 
insight as to how Apple is able to innovate in so many diverse 
industries and never lose its ability to do so. It explains why people 
tattoo Harley-Davidson logos on their bodies. It provides a clearer 
understanding not just of how Southwest Airlines created the most 
profitable airline in history, but why the things it did worked. It 
even gives some clarity as to why people followed Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King Jr. in a movement that changed a nation and why we took 
up John F. Kennedy's challenge to put a man on the moon even after 
he died. The Golden Circle shows how these leaders were able to 
inspire action instead of manipulating people to act. 
This alternative perspective is not just useful for changing the 
world; there are practical applications for the ability to inspire, too. 
It can be used as a guide to vastly improving leadership, corporate 
culture, hiring, product development, sales, and marketing. It even 


--- Page 50 ---
THE GOLDEN CIRCLE 
43 
explains loyalty and how to create enough momentum to turn an 
idea into a social movement. 
And it all starts from the inside out. It all starts with Why. 
Before we can explore its applications, let me first define the 
terms, starting from the outside of the circle and moving inward. 
WHAT: Every single company and organization on the planet 
knows WHAT they do. This is true no matter how big or small, no 
matter what industry. Everyone is easily able to describe the prod-
ucts or services a company sells or the job function they have within 
that system. WHATs are easy to identify. 
HOW: Some companies and people know HOW they do WHAT 
they do. Whether you call them a "differentiating value proposi-
tion," "proprietary process" or "unique selling proposition," HOWs 
are often given to explain how something is different or better. Not 
as obvious as WHATs, many think these are the differentiating or 
motivating factors in a decision. It would be false to assume that's 
all that is required. There is one missing detail: 
WHY: Very few people or companies can clearly articulate WHY 
they do WHAT they do. When I say WHY, I don't mean to make 
money—that's a result. By WHY I mean what is your purpose, 
cause or belief? WHY does your company exist? WHY do you get 
out of bed every morning? And WHY should anyone care? 
When most organizations or people think, act or communicate 
they do so from the outside in, from WHAT to WHY. And for good 
reason—they go from clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. We say 
WHAT we do, we sometimes say HOW we do it, but we rarely say 
WHY we do WHAT we do. 
But not the inspired companies. Not the inspired leaders. Every 
single one of them, regardless of their size or their industry, thinks, 
acts and communicates from the inside out. 
I use Apple Inc. frequently as an example simply because they 
have broad recognition and their products are easy to grasp and 


--- Page 51 ---
START WITH WHY 
44 
compare to others. What's more, Apple's success over time is not 
typical. Their ability to remain one of the most innovative 
companies year after year, combined with their uncanny ability to 
attract a cultlike following, makes them a great example to 
demonstrate many of the principles of The Golden Circle. 
I'll start with a simple marketing example. 
If Apple were like most other companies, a marketing message 
from them would move from the outside in of The Golden Circle. It 
would start with some statement of WHAT the company does or 
makes, followed by HOW they think they are different or better 
than the competition, followed by some call to action. With that, the 
company would expect some behavior in return, in this case a pur-
chase. A marketing message from Apple, if they were like everyone 
else, might sound like this: 
We make great computers. 
They're beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly. 
Wanna buy one? 
It's not a very compelling sales pitch, but that's how most 
companies sell to us. This is the norm. First they start with WHAT 
they do-—"Here's our new car." Then they tell us how they do it or 
how they are better—"It's got leather seats, great gas mileage, and 
great financing." And then they make a call to action and expect a 
behavior. 
You see this pattern in business-to-consumer markets as well as 
business-to-business environments: "Here's our law firm. Our law-
yers went to the best schools and we represent the biggest clients. 
Hire us." This pattern is also alive and well in politics—"Here's the 
candidate, here are her views on taxes and immigration. See how's 
she's different? Vote for her." In every case, the communication is 
organized in an attempt to convince someone of a difference or 
superior value. 


--- Page 52 ---
THE GOLDEN CIRCLE 
45 
But that is not what the inspiring leaders and organizations do. 
Every one of them, regardless of size or industry, thinks, acts and 
communicates from the inside out. 
Let's look at that Apple example again and rewrite the example 
in the order Apple actually communicates. This time, the example 
starts with WHY. 
Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We 
believe in thinking differently. 
The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products 
beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly. 
And we happen to make great computers. 
Wanna buy one? 
It's a completely different message. It actually feels different from 
the first one. We're much more eager to buy a computer from Apple 
after reading the second version—and all I did was reverse the 
order of the information. There's no trickery, no manipulation, no 
free stuff, no aspirational messages, no celebrities. 
Apple doesn't simply reverse the order of information, their 
message starts with WHY, a purpose, cause or belief that has noth-
ing to do with WHAT they do. WHAT they do—the products they 
make, from computers to small electronics—no longer serves as the 
reason to buy, they serve as the tangible proof of their cause. The 
design and user interface of Apple products, though important, are 
not enough in themselves to generate such astounding loyalty 
among their customers. Those important elements help make the 
cause tangible and rational. Others can hire top designers and 
brilliant engineers and make beautiful, easy-to-use products and 
copy the things Apple does, and they could even steal away Apple 
employees to do it, but the results would not be the same. Simply 
copying WHAT Apple does or HOW it does it won't work. There is 
something more, something hard to describe and near impossible to 


--- Page 53 ---
START WITH WHY 
46 
copy that gives Apple such a disproportionate level of influence in 
the market. The example starts to prove that people don't buy 
WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it. 
It's worth repeating: people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy 
WHY you do it. 
Apple's ability to design such innovative products so consis- tently 
and their ability to command such astounding loyalty for their 
products comes from more than simply WHAT they do. The 
problem is, organizations use the tangible features and benefits to 
build a rational argument for why their company, product or idea is 
better than another. Sometimes those comparisons are made 
outright and sometimes analogies or metaphors are drawn, but the 
effect is the same. Companies try to sell us WHAT they do, but we 
buy WHY they do it. This is what I mean when 1 say they com-
municate from the outside in; they lead with WHAT and HOW. 
When communicating from the inside out, however, the WHY is 
offered as the reason to buy and the WHATs serve as the tangible 
proof of that belief. The things we can point to rationalize or explain 
the reasons we're drawn to one product, company or idea over 
another. 
WHAT companies do are external factors, but WHY they do it is 
something deeper. In practical terms, there is nothing special about 
Apple. It is just a company like any other. There is no real difference 
between Apple and any of its competitors—Dell, HP, Gateway, 
Toshiba. Pick one, it doesn't matter. They are all corporate 
structures. That's all a company is. It's a structure. They all make 
computers. They all have some systems that work and some that 
don't. They all have equal access to the same talent, the same re-
sources, the same agencies, the same consultants and the same 
media. They all have some good managers, some good designers 
and smart engineers. They all make some products that work well 
and some that don't. . . even Apple. Why, then, does Apple have 


--- Page 54 ---
THE GOLDEN CIRCLE 
47 
such a disproportionate level of success? Why are they more 
innovative? Why are they consistently more profitable? And how 
did they manage to build such a cultish loyal following—something 
very few companies are ever able to achieve? 
People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it. This is 
the reason Apple has earned a remarkable level of flexibility. People 
are obviously comfortable buying a computer from Apple. But 
people are also perfectly comfortable buying an mp3 player from 
them, or a cell phone or a DVR. Consumers and investors are 
completely at ease with Apple offering so many different products 
in so many different categories. It's not WHAT Apple does that 
distinguishes them. It is WHY they do it. Their products give life to 
their cause. 
I'm not so foolhardy as to propose that their products don't 
matter; of course they do. But it's the reason they matter that is 
contrary to the conventional wisdom. Their products, unto them-
selves, are not the reason Apple is perceived as superior; their prod-
ucts, WHAT Apple makes, serve as the tangible proof of what they 
believe. It is that clear correlation between WHAT they do and 
WHY they do it that makes Apple stand out. This is the reason we 
perceive Apple as being authentic. Everything they do works to 
demonstrate their WHY, to challenge the status quo. Regardless of 
the products they make or industry in which they operate, it is 
always clear that Apple "thinks different." 
When Apple first came out with the Macintosh, having an op-
erating system based on a graphical user interface and not a com-
plicated computer language challenged how computers worked at 
the time. What's more, where most technology companies saw their 
biggest marketing opportunity among businesses, Apple wanted to 
give an individual sitting at home the same power as any company. 
Apple's WHY, to challenge the status quo and to empower the in-
dividual, is a pattern in that it repeats in all they say and do. It

comes to life in their iPod and even more so in iTunes, a service that 
challenged the status quo of the music industry's distribution model 
and was better suited to how individuals consumed music. 
The music industry was organized to sell albums, a model that 
evolved during a time when listening to music was largely an 
activity we did at home. Sony changed that in 1979 with the intro-
duction of the Walkman. But even the Walkman, and later the 
Discman, was limited to the number of cassette tapes or CDs you 
could carry in addition to the device. The development of the mp3 
music format changed all that. Digital compression allowed for a 
very high quantity of songs to be stored on relatively inexpensive 
and highly portable digital music devices. Our ability to walk out of 
the house with only one easy-to-carry device transformed music 
into something we largely listened to away from home. And the 
mp3 not only changed where we listened to music, it also trans-
formed us from an album-collecting culture to a song-collecting 
culture. While the music industry was still busy trying to sell us 
albums, a model that no longer suited consumer behavior, Apple 
introduced their iPod by offering us "1,000 songs in your pocket." 
With the iPod and iTunes, Apple did a much better job of com-
municating the value of both the mp3 and the mp3 player relative to 
how we lived our lives. Their advertising didn't offer exhaustive 
descriptions of product details; it wasn't about them, it was about 
us. And we understood WHY we wanted it. 
Apple did not invent the mp3, nor did they invent the technol-
ogy that became the iPod, yet they are credited with transforming 
the music industry with it. The multigigabyte portable hard drive 
music player was actually invented by Creative Technology Ltd., a 
Singapore-based technology company that rose to prominence by 
making the Sound Blaster audio technology that enables home PCs 
to have sound. In fact, Apple didn't introduce the iPod until twenty-
two months after Creative's entry into the market. This detail alone 


--- Page 56 ---
THE GOLDEN CIRCLE 
49 
calls into question the assumption of a first mover's advantage. 
Given their history in digital sound, Creative was more qualified 
than Apple to introduce a digital music product. The problem was, 
they advertised their product as a "5GB mp3 player." It is exactly the 
same message as Apple's "1,000 songs in your pocket." The 
difference is Creative told us WHAT their product was and Apple 
told us WHY we needed it. 
Only later, once we decided we had to have an iPod, did the 
WHAT matter—and we chose the 5GB version, 10GB version, and 
so on, the tangible details that proved we could get the 1,000 songs 
in our pocket. Our decision started with WHY, and so did Apple's 
offering. 
How many of us can say with certainty that, indeed, an iPod is 
actually better than Creative's Zen? iPods, for example, are still 
plagued with battery life and battery replacement issues. They tend 
to just die. Maybe a Zen is better. The reality is, we don't even care if 
it is. People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it. 
And it is Apple's clarity of WHY that gives them such a remarkable 
ability to innovate, often competing against companies seemingly 
more qualified than they, and succeed in industries outside their 
core business. 
The same cannot be said for companies with a fuz2y sense of 
WHY. When an organization defines itself by WHAT it does, that's 
all it will ever be able to do. Apple's competitors, having defined 
themselves by their products or services, regardless of their "differ-
entiating value proposition," are not afforded the same freedom. 
Gateway, for example, started selling flat-screen TVs in 2003. 
Having made flat-screen monitors for years, they were every bit as 
qualified to make and sell TVs. But the company failed to make a 
credible name for itself among consumer electronics brands and 
gave up the business two years later to focus on its "core business." 
Dell came out with PDAs in 2002 and mp3 players in 2003, but 


--- Page 57 ---
START WITH WHY 
50 
lasted only a few years in each market. Dell makes good-quality 
products and is fully qualified to produce these other technologies. 
The problem was they had defined themselves by WHAT they did; 
they made computers, and it simply didn't make sense to us to buy 
a PDA or mp3 player from them. It didn't feel right. How many 
people do you think would stand on line for six hours to buy a new 
cell phone from Dell, as they did for the release of Apple's iPhone? 
People couldn't see Dell as anything more than a computer 
company. It just didn't make sense. Poor sales quickly ended Dell's 
desire to enter the small electronic goods market; instead they opted 
to "focus on their core business." Unless Dell, like so many others, 
can rediscover their founding purpose, cause or belief and start with 
WHY in all they say and do, all they will ever do is sell computers. 
They will be stuck in their "core business." 
Apple, unlike its competitors, has defined itself by WHY it does 
things, not WHAT it does. It is not a computer company, but a 
company that challenges the status quo and offers individuals sim-
pler alternatives. Apple even changed its legal name in 2007 from 
Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple Inc. to reflect the fact that they were 
more than just a computer company. Practically speaking, it doesn't 
really matter what a company's legal name is. For Apple, however, 
having the word "Computer" in their name didn't limit WHAT they 
could do. It limited how they thought of themselves. The change 
wasn't practical, it was philosophical. 
Apple's WHY was formed at its founding in the late 1970s and 
hasn't changed to this date. Regardless of the products they make or 
the industries into which they migrate, their WHY still remains a 
constant. And Apple's intention to challenge accepted thinking has 
proved prophetic. As a computer company they redirected the 
course of the personal computing industry. As a small electronics 
company they have challenged the traditional dominance of com-
panies like Sony and Philips. As a purveyor of mobile phones they 


--- Page 58 ---
THE GOLDEN CIRCLE 
51 
pushed the old hands—Motorola, Ericsson, and Nokia—to reex-
amine their own businesses. Apple's ability to enter and even dom-
inate so many different industries has even challenged what it 
means to be a computer company in the first place. Regardless of 
WHAT it does, we know WHY Apple exists. 
The same cannot be said for their competitors. Although they all 
had a clear sense of WHY at some point—it was one of the primary 
factors that helped each of them become billion-dollar companies—
over the course of time, all of Apple's competitors lost their WHY. 
Now all those companies define themselves by WHAT they do: we 
make computers. They turned from companies with a cause into 
companies that sold products. And when that happens, price, 
quality, service and features become the primary currency to 
motivate a purchase decision. At that point a company and its 
products have ostensibly become commodities. As any company 
forced to compete on price, quality, service or features alone can 
attest, it is very hard to differentiate for any period of time or build 
loyalty on those factors alone. Plus it costs money and is stressful 
waking up every day trying to compete on that level alone. Know-
ing WHY is essential for lasting success and the ability to avoid 
being lumped in with others. 
Any company faced with the challenge of how to differentiate 
themselves in their market is basically a commodity, regardless of 
WHAT they do or HOW they do it. Ask a milk producer, for ex-
ample, and they will tell you that there are actually variations 
among milk brands. The problem is you have to be an expert to 
understand the differences. To the outside world, all milk is basi-
cally the same, so we just lump all the brands together and call it a 
commodity. In response, that's how the industry acts. This is largely 
the pattern for almost every other product or service on the market 
today, business-to-consumer or business-to-business. They focus on 
WHAT they do and HOW they do it without consideration of WHY; 


--- Page 59 ---
START WITH WHY 
52 
we lump them together and they act like commodities. The more we 
treat them like commodities, the more they focus on WHAT and 
HOW they do it. It's a vicious cycle. But only companies that act like 
commodities are the ones who wake up every day with the 
challenge of how to differentiate. Companies and organizations 
with a clear sense of WHY never worry about it. They don't think of 
themselves as being like anyone else and they don't have to 
"convince" anyone of their value. They don't need complex systems 
of carrots and sticks. They are different, and everyone knows it. 
They start with WHY in everything they say and do. 
There are those who still believe that Apple's difference comes 
from its marketing ability. Apple "sells a lifestyle," marketing pro-
fessionals will tell you. Then how come these marketing profes-
sionals haven't intentionally repeated Apple's success and longevity 
for another company? Calling it a "lifestyle" is a recognition that 
people who live a certain way choose to incorporate Apple into their 
lives. Apple didn't invent the lifestyle, nor does it sell a lifestyle. 
Apple is simply one of the brands that those who live a certain 
lifestyle are drawn to. Those people use certain products or brands 
in the course of living in that lifestyle; that is, in part, how we 
recognize their way of life in the first place. The products they 
choose become proof of WHY they do the things they do. It is only 
because Apple's WHY is so clear that those who believe what they 
believe are drawn to them. As Harley-Davidson fits into the lifestyle 
of a certain group of people and Prada shoes fit the lifestyle of 
another group, it is the lifestyle that came first. Like the products the 
company produces that serve as proof of the company's WHY, so 
too does a brand or product serve as proof of an individual's WHY. 
Others, even some who work for Apple, will say that what truly 
distinguishes Apple is in fact the quality of their products alone. 
Having good-quality products is of course important. No matter 
how clear your WHY, if WHAT you sell doesn't work, the whole 


--- Page 60 ---
THE GOLDEN CIRCLE 
53 
thing falls flat. But a company doesn't need to have the best 
products, they just need to be good or very good. Better or best is a 
relative comparison. Without first understanding WHY, the com-
parison itself is of no value to the decision maker. 
The concept of "better" begs the question: based on what standard? 
Is a Ferrari F430 sports car better than a Honda Odyssey minivan? It 
depends why you need the car. If you have a family of six, a two-
seater Ferrari is not better. However, if you're looking for a great 
way to meet women, a Honda minivan is probably not better (de-
pending on what kind of woman you're looking to meet, I guess; I 
too shouldn't make assumptions). Why the product exists must first 
be considered and why someone wants it must match. I could tell 
you about all the engineering marvels of the Honda Odyssey, some 
of which may actually be better than a Ferrari. It certainly gets 
better gas mileage. The odds are that I'm not going to convince 
someone who really wants that sports car to buy anything else. That 
some people are viscerally drawn to a Ferrari more than a Honda 
Odyssey says more about the person than the engineering of the 
product. The engineering, for example, would simply be one of the 
tangible points that a Ferrari lover could point out to prove how he 
feels about the car. The dogged defense of the superiority of the 
Ferrari from the person whose personality is predisposed to favor 
all the features and benefits of a Ferrari cannot be an objective 
conversation. Why do you think most people who buy Ferraris are 
willing to pay a premium to get it in red whereas most who buy 
Honda Odysseys probably don't care much about the color at all? 
For all those who will try to convince you that Apple computers 
are just better, I cannot dispute a single claim. All I can offer is that 
most of the factors that they believe make them better meet their 
standard of what a computer should do. With that in mind, Macin-
toshes are, in practice, only better for those who believe what Apple 
believes. Those people who share Apple's WHY believe that Apple's

products are objectively better, and any attempt to convince them 
otherwise is pointless. Even with objective metrics in hand, the 
argument about which is better or which is worse without first 
establishing a common standard creates nothing more than debate. 
Loyalists for each brand will point to various features and benefits 
that matter to them (or don't matter to them) in an attempt to 
convince the other that they are right. And that's one of the primary 
reasons why so many companies feel the need to differentiate in the 
first place—based on the flawed assumption that only one group 
can be right. But what if both parties were right? What if an Apple 
was right for some people and a PC was right for others? It's not a 
debate about better or worse anymore, it's a discussion about 
different needs. And before the discussion can even happen, the 
WHYs for each must be established first. 
A simple claim of better, even with the rational evidence to back 
it up, can create desire and even motivate a decision to buy, but it 
doesn't create loyalty. If a customer feels inspired to buy a product, 
rather than manipulated, they will be able to verbalize the reasons 
why they think what they bought is better. Good quality and fea-
tures matter, but they are not enough to produce the dogged loyalty 
that all the most inspiring leaders and companies are able to com-
mand. It is the cause that is represented by the company, brand, 
product or person that inspires loyalty. 
 
Not the Only Way, Just One Way 
Knowing your WHY is not the only way to be successful, but it is 
the only way to maintain a lasting success and have a greater blend 
of innovation and flexibility. When a WHY goes fuzzy, it becomes 
much more difficult to maintain the growth, loyalty and inspiration 
that helped drive the original success. By difficult, I mean that 
manipulation rather than inspiration fast becomes the strategy of

choice to motivate behavior. This is effective in the short term but 
comes at a high cost in the long term. 
Consider the classic business school case of the railroads. In the 
late 1800s, the railroads were the biggest companies in the country. 
Having achieved such monumental success, even changing the 
landscape of America, remembering WHY stopped being important 
to them. Instead they became obsessed with WHAT they did— they 
were in the railroad business. This narrowing of perspective 
influenced their decision-making—they invested all their money in 
tracks and crossties and engines. But at the beginning of the 
twentieth century, a new technology was introduced: the airplane. 
And all those big railroad companies eventually went out of busi-
ness. What if they had defined themselves as being in the mass 
transportation business? Perhaps their behavior would have been 
different. Perhaps they would have seen opportunities that they 
otherwise missed. Perhaps they would own all the airlines today. 
The comparison raises the question of the long-term survivability 
of so many other companies that have defined themselves and their 
industries by WHAT they do. They have been doing it the same way 
for so long that their ability to compete against a new technology or 
see a new perspective becomes a daunting task. The story of the 
railroads has eerie similarities to the case of the music industry 
discussed earlier. This is another industry that has not done a good 
job of adjusting its business model to fit a behavioral change 
prompted by a new technology. But other industries whose business 
models evolved in a different time show similar cracks— the 
newspaper, publishing and television industries, to name but three. 
These are the current-day railroads that are struggling to define 
their value while watching their customers turn to companies from 
other industries to serve their needs. Perhaps if music companies 
had a clearer sense of WHY, they would have seen the opportunity

to invent the equivalent of iTunes instead of leaving it to a scrappy 
computer company. 
In all cases, going back to the original purpose, cause or belief 
will help these industries adapt. Instead of asking, "WHAT should 
we do to compete?" the questions must be asked, "WHY did we start 
doing WHAT we're doing in the first place, and WHAT can we do 
to bring our cause to life considering all the technologies and market 
opportunities available today?" But don't take my word for it. None 
of this is my opinion. It is all firmly grounded in the tenets of 
biology.

Now, the Star-Belly Sneetches had bellies with stars. 
The Plain-Belly Sneetches had none upon thars. Those 
stars weren't so big. They were really so small. You 
might think such a thing wouldn't matter at all. 
 
Then, quickly, Sylvester McMonkey McBean 
Put together a very peculiar machine. 
And he said, "You want stars like a Star-Belly Sneetch? 
My friends, you can have them for three dollars each!" 


--- Page 65 ---
START WITH WHY 
58 
In his 1961 story about the Sneetches, Dr. Seuss introduced us to 
two groups of Sneetches, one with stars on their bellies and the 
other with none. The ones without stars wanted desperately to get 
stars so they could feel like they fit in. They were willing to go to 
extreme lengths and pay larger and larger sums of money simply to 
feel like they were part of a group. But only Sylvester McMonkey 
McBean, the man whose machine puts "stars upon thars," profited 
from the Sneetches' desire to fit in. 
As with so many things, Dr. Seuss explained it best. The 
Sneetches perfectly capture a very basic human need—the need to 
belong. Our need to belong is not rational, but it is a constant that 
exists across all people in all cultures. It is a feeling we get when 
those around us share our values and beliefs. When we feel like we 
belong we feel connected and we feel safe. As humans we crave the 
feeling and we seek it out. 
Sometimes our feeling of belonging is incidental. We're not 
friends with everyone from our hometown, but travel across the 
state, and you may meet someone from your hometown and you 
instantly have a connection with them. We're not friends with ev-
eryone from our home state, but travel across the country, and 
you'll feel a special bond with someone you meet who is from your 
home state. Go abroad and you'll form instant bonds with other 
Americans you meet. I remember a trip I took to Australia. One day 
I was on a bus and heard an American accent. I turned and struck 
up a conversation. I immediately felt connected to them, we could 
speak the same language, understand the same slang. As a stranger 
in a strange city, for that brief moment, I felt like I belonged, and 
because of it, I trusted those strangers on the bus more than any 
other passengers. In fact, we spent time together later. No matter 
where we go, we trust those with whom we are able to perceive 
common values or beliefs. 


--- Page 66 ---
THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY 
59 
Our desire to feel like we belong is so powerful that we will go to 
great lengths, do irrational things and often spend money to get that 
feeling. Like the Sneetches, we want to be around people and 
organizations who are like us and share our beliefs. When 
companies talk about WHAT they do and how advanced their 
products are, they may have appeal, but they do not necessarily 
represent something to which we want to belong. But when a 
company clearly communicates their WHY, what they believe, and 
we believe what they believe, then we will sometimes go to 
extraordinary lengths to include those products or brands in our 
lives. This is not because they are better, but because they become 
markers or symbols of the values and beliefs we hold dear. Those 
products and brands make us feel like we belong and we feel a 
kinship with others who buy the same things. Fan clubs, started by 
customers, are often formed without any help from the company 
itself. These people form communities, in person or online, not just 
to share their love of a product with others, but to be in the 
company of people like them. Their decisions have nothing to do 
with the company or its products; they have everything to do with 
the individuals themselves. 
Our natural need to belong also makes us good at spotting 
things that don't belong. It's a sense we get. A feeling. Something 
deep inside us, something we can't put into words, allows us to feel 
how some things just fit and some things just don't. Dell selling mp3 
players just doesn't feel right because Dell defines itself as a 
computer company, so the only things that belong are computers. 
Apple defines itself as a company on a mission and so anything 
they do that fits that definition feels like it belongs. In 2004, they 
produced a promotional iPod in partnership with the iconoclastic 
Irish rock band U2. That makes sense. They would never have 
produced a promotional iPod with Celine Dion, even though she's 
sold vastly more records than U2 and may have a bigger audience. 


--- Page 67 ---
START WITH WHY 
60 
U2 and Apple belong together because they share the same values 
and beliefs. They both push boundaries. It would not have made 
sense if Apple released a special iPod with Celine Dion. As big as 
her audience may be, the partnership just doesn't align. 
Look no farther than Apple's TV commercials "I'm a Mac and I'm 
a PC" for a perfect representation of who a Mac user needs to be to 
feel like they belong. In the commercial, the Mac user is a young 
guy, always in jeans and a T-shirt, always relaxed and always 
having a sense of humor poking fun at "the system." The PC, as 
defined by Apple, is in a suit. Older. Stodgy. To fit in with Mac, you 
have to be like Mac. Microsoft responded to Apple with its own "I'm 
a PC" campaign, which depicts people from all walks of life 
identifying themselves as "PC." Microsoft included many more 
people in their ads—teachers, scientists, musicians and children. As 
one would expect from the company that supplies 95 percent of the 
computer operating systems, to belong to that crowd, you have to 
be everyone else. One is not better or worse; it depends on where 
you feel like you belong. Are you a rabble-rouser or are you with 
the majority? 
We are drawn to leaders and organizations that are good at 
communicating what they believe. Their ability to make us feel like 
we belong, to make us feel special, safe and not alone is part of what 
gives them the ability to inspire us. Those whom we consider great 
leaders all have an ability to draw us close and to command our 
loyalty. And we feel a strong bond with those who are also drawn 
to the same leaders and organizations. Apple users feel a bond with 
each other. Harley riders are bonded to each other. Anyone who 
was drawn to hear Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. give his "I Have a 
Dream" speech, regardless of race, religion or sex, stood together in 
that crowd as brothers and sisters, bonded by their shared values 
and beliefs. They knew they belonged together because they could 
feel it in their gut.

Gut Decisions Don't Happen in Your Stomach 
The principles of The Golden Circle are much more than a com-
munications hierarchy. Its principles are deeply grounded in the 
evolution of human behavior. The power of WHY is not opinion, it's 
biology. If you look at a cross section of the human brain, from the 
top down, you see that the levels of The Golden Circle correspond 
precisely with the three major levels of the brain. 
The newest area of the brain, our Homo sapien brain, is the 
 
 
neocortex, which corresponds with the WHAT level. The neocortex 
is responsible for rational and analytical thought and language. 
The middle two sections comprise the limbic brain. The limbic 
brain is responsible for all of our feelings, such as trust and loyalty. 
It is also responsible for all human behavior and all our decision-
making, but it has no capacity for language. 
When we communicate from the outside in, when we commu-
nicate WHAT we do first, yes, people can understand vast amounts 
of complicated information, like facts and features, but it does not 
drive behavior. But when we communicate from the inside out, 
we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls decision-


--- Page 69 ---
START WITH WHY 
62 
making, and our language part of the brain allows us to rationalize 
those decisions. 
The part of the brain that controls our feelings has no capacity for 
language. It is this disconnection that makes putting our feelings 
into words so hard. We have trouble, for example, explaining why 
we married the person we married. We struggle to put into words 
the real reasons why we love them, so we talk around it or 
rationalize it. "She's funny, she's smart," we start. But there are lots 
of funny and smart people in the world, but we don't love them and 
we don't want to marry them. There is obviously more to falling in 
love than just personality and competence. Rationally, we know our 
explanation isn't the real reason. It is how our loved ones make us 
feel, but those feelings are really hard to put into words. So when 
pushed, we start to talk around it. We may even say things that 
don't make any rational sense. "She completes me," we might say, 
for example. What does that mean and how do you look for 
someone who does that so you can marry them? That's the problem 
with love; we only know when we've found it because it "just feels 
right." 
The same is true for other decisions. When a decision feels right, 
we have a hard time explaining why we did what we did. Again, 
the part of the brain that controls decision-making doesn't control 
language, so we rationalize. This complicates the value of polls or 
market research. Asking people why they chose you over another 
may provide wonderful evidence of how they have rationalized the 
decision, but it does not shed much light on the true motivation for 
the decision. It's not that people don't know, it's that they have 
trouble explaining why they do what they do. Decision-making and 
the ability to explain those decisions exist in different parts of the 
brain. 
This is where "gut decisions" come from. They just feel right. 
There is no part of the stomach that controls decision-making, it all 


--- Page 70 ---
THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY 
63 
happens in the limbic brain. It's not an accident that we use that 
word "feel" to explain those decisions either. The reason gut deci-
sions feel right is because the part of the brain that controls them 
also controls our feelings. Whether you defer to your gut or you're 
simply following your heart, no matter which part of the body you 
think is driving the decision, the reality is it's all in your limbic 
brain. 
Our limbic brain is powerful, powerful enough to drive behavior 
that sometimes contradicts our rational and analytical under-
standing of a situation. We often trust our gut even if the decision 
flies in the face of all the facts and figures. Richard Restak, a well- 
known neuroscientist, talks about this in his book The Naked Brain. 
When you force people to make decisions with only the rational 
part of their brain, they almost invariably end up "overthinking." 
These rational decisions tend to take longer to make, says Restak, 
and can often be of lower quality. In contrast, decisions made with 
the limbic brain, gut decisions, tend to be faster, higher-quality 
decisions. This is one of the primary reasons why teachers tell stu-
dents to go with their first instinct when taking a multiple-choice 
test, to trust their gut. The more time spent thinking about the 
answer, the bigger the risk that it may be the wrong one. Our 
limbic brains are smart and often know the right thing to do. It is 
our inability to verbalize the reasons that may cause us to doubt 
ourselves or trust the empirical evidence when our gut tells us not 
to. 
Consider the experience of buying a flat-screen TV at your local 
electronics store. You stand in the aisle listening to an expert explain 
to you the difference between LCD and plasma. The sales rep gives 
you all the rational differences and benefits, yet you are still none 
the wiser as to which one is best for you. After an hour, you still 
have no clue. Your mind is on overload because you're over- 
thinking the decision. You eventually make a choice and walk out of 


--- Page 71 ---
START WITH WHY 
64 
the store, still not 100 percent convinced you chose the right one. 
Then you go to your friend's house and see that he bought the 
"other one." He goes on and on about how much he loves his TV. 
Suddenly you're jealous, even though you still don't know that his 
is any better than yours. You wonder, "Did I buy the wrong one?" 
Companies that fail to communicate a sense of WHY force us to 
make decisions with only empirical evidence. This is why those de-
cisions take more time, feel difficult or leave us uncertain. Under 
these conditions manipulative strategies that exploit our desires, 
fears, doubts or fantasies work very well. We're forced to make 
these less-than-inspiring decisions for one simple reason—
companies don't offer us anything else besides the facts and figures, 
features and benefits upon which to base our decisions. Companies 
don't tell us WHY. 
People don't buy WHAT you do; they buy WHY you do it. A 
failure to communicate WHY creates nothing but stress or doubt. In 
contrast, many people who are drawn to buy Macintosh computers 
or Harley-Davidson motorcycles, for example, don't need to talk to 
anyone about which brand to choose. They feel the utmost 
confidence in their decision and the only question they ask is which 
Mac or which Harley. At that level, the rational features and bene-
fits, facts and figures absolutely matter, but not to drive the decision 
to give money or loyalty to the company or brand. That decision is 
already made. The tangible features are simply to help direct the 
choice of product that best fits our needs. In these cases, the deci-
sions happened in the perfect inside-out order. Those decisions 
started with WHY—the emotional component of the decision— and 
then the rational components allowed the buyer to verbalize or 
rationalize the reasons for their decision. 
This is what we mean when we talk about winning hearts and 
minds. The heart represents the limbic, feeling part of the brain, and 
the mind is the rational, language center. Most companies are quite 


--- Page 72 ---
THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY 
65 
adept at winning minds; all that requires is a comparison of all the 
features and benefits. Winning hearts, however, takes more work. 
Given the evidence of the natural order of decision-making, I can't 
help but wonder if the order of the expression "hearts and minds" is 
a coincidence. Why does no one set out to win "minds and hearts"? 
The ability to win hearts before minds is not easy. It's a delicate 
balance of art and science—another coincidental grammatical 
construction. Why is it that things are not a balance of science and 
art, but always art before science? Perhaps it is a subtle clue our 
language-impaired limbic brain is sending us to help us see that the 
art of leading is about following your heart. Perhaps our brains are 
trying to tell us that WHY must come first. 
Absent a WHY, a decision is harder to make. And when in doubt 
we look to science, to data, to guide decisions. Companies will tell 
you that the reason they start with WHAT they do or HOW they do 
it is because that's what their customers asked for. Quality. Service. 
Price. Features. That's what the data reported. But for the fact that 
the part of the brain that controls decision-making is different from 
the part of the brain that is able to report back that decision, it 
would be a perfectly valid conclusion to give people what they ask 
for. Unfortunately, there is more evidence that sales don't sig-
nificantly increase and bonds of loyalty are not formed simply when 
companies say or do everything their customers want. Henry Ford 
summed it up best. "If I had asked people what they wanted," he 
said, "they would have said a faster horse." 
This is the genius of great leadership. Great leaders and great 
organizations are good at seeing what most of us can't see. They are 
good at giving us things we would never think of asking for. When 
the computer revolution was afoot, computer users couldn't ask for 
a graphical user interface. But that's what Apple gave us. In the face 
of expanding competition in the airline industry, most air travelers 
would never have thought to ask for less instead of more. But that's 


--- Page 73 ---
START WITH WHY 
66 
what Southwest did. And in the face of hard times and 
overwhelming odds, few would have asked their country, what can 
I do for you over what can you do for me? The very cause upon 
which John F. Kennedy introduced his presidency. Great leaders are 
those who trust their gut. They are those who understand the art 
before the science. They win hearts before minds. They are the ones 
who start with WHY. 
We make decisions all day long, and many of them are emotion-
ally driven. Rarely do we sift through all the available information 
to ensure we know every fact. And we don't need to. It is all about 
degrees of certainty. "I can make a decision with 30 percent of the 
information," said former secretary of state Colin Powell. "Anything 
more than 80 percent is too much." There is always a level at which 
we trust ourselves or those around us to guide us, and don't always 
feel we need all the facts and figures. And sometimes we just may 
not trust ourselves to make a certain decision yet. This may explain 
why we feel (there's that word again) so uncomfortable when others 
twist our arm to make a decision that doesn't sit well in our gut. We 
trust our gut to help us decide whom to vote for or which shampoo 
to buy. Because our biology complicates our ability to verbalize the 
real reasons why we make the decisions we do, we rationalize based 
on more tangible factors, like the design or the service or the brand. 
This is the basis for the false assumption that price or features mat- 
ter more than they do. Those things matter, they provide us the 
tangible things we can point to to rationalize our decision-making, 
but they don't set the course and they don't inspire behavior. 
It's What You Can't See That Matters 
"Gets your whites whiter and your brights brighter," said the TV 
commercial for the newest laundry detergent. This was the value 
proposition for so many years in the laundry detergent business. A 
perfectly legitimate claim. That's what the market research revealed 


--- Page 74 ---
THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY 
67 
customers wanted. The data was true, but the truth of what people 
wanted was different. 
The makers of laundry detergent asked consumers WHAT they 
wanted from detergent, and consumers said whiter whites and 
brighter brights. Not such a remarkable finding, if you think about 
it, that people doing laundry wanted their detergent to help get their 
clothes not just clean, but very clean. So brands attempted to dif-
ferentiate HOW they got your whites whiter and brights brighter by 
trying to convince consumers that one additive was more effective 
than another. Protein, said one brand. Color enhancers, said another. 
No one asked customers WHY they wanted their clothes clean. That 
little nugget wasn't revealed until many years later when a group of 
anthropologists hired by one of the packaged-goods companies 
revealed that all those additives weren't in fact driving behavior. 
They observed that when people took their washing out of the 
dryer, no one held it up to the light to see how white it was or 
compared it to newer items to see how bright it was. The first thing 
people did when they pulled their laundry out of the dryer was to 
smell it. This was an amazing discovery. Feeling clean was more im-
portant to people than being clean. There was a presumption that all 
detergents get your clothes clean. That's what detergent is supposed 
to do. But having their clothes smell fresh and clean mattered much 
more than the nuanced differences between which detergent 
actually made clothes measurably cleaner. 
That a false assumption swayed an entire industry to follow the 
wrong direction is not unique to detergents. Cell phone companies 
believed people wanted more options and buttons until Apple in-
troduced its iPhone with fewer options and only one button. The 
German automakers believed their engineering alone mattered to 
American car buyers. They were stunned and perplexed when they 
learned that great engineering wasn't enough. One by one, the 
German luxury car makers begrudgingly added cup holders to their 


--- Page 75 ---
START WITH WHY 
68 
fine automobiles. It was a feature that mattered a great deal to 
commuter-minded Americans, but was rarely mentioned in any 
research about what factors influenced purchase decisions. I am not, 
for a moment, proposing that cup holders make people loyal to 
BMWs. All I am proposing is that even for rationally minded car 
buyers, there is more to decision-making than meets the eye. 
Literally. 
The power of the limbic brain is astounding. It not only controls 
our gut decisions, but it can influence us to do things that seem 
illogical or irrational. Leaving the safety of home to explore faraway 
places. Crossing oceans to see what's on the other side. Leaving a 
stable job to start a business out of your basement with no money in 
the bank. Many of us look at these decisions and say, "That's stupid, 
you're crazy. You could lose everything. You could get yourself 
killed. What are you thinking?" It is not logic or facts but our hopes 
and dreams, our hearts and our guts, that drive us to try new things. 
If we were all rational, there would be no small businesses, there 
would be no exploration, there would be very little innovation and 
there would be no great leaders to inspire all those things. It is the 
undying belief in something bigger and better that drives that kind 
of behavior. But it can also control behavior born out of other 
emotions, like hate or fear. Why else would someone plot to hurt 
someone they had never met? 
The amount of market research that reveals that people want to 
do business with the company that offers them the best-quality 
products, with the most features, the best service and all at a good 
price is astounding. But consider the companies with the greatest 
loyalty—they rarely have all those things. If you wanted to buy a 
custom Harley-Davidson, you used to wait six months for delivery 
(to give them credit, they've got it down from a year). That's bad 
service! Apple's computers are at least 25 percent more expensive 
than a comparable PC. There is less software available for their 


--- Page 76 ---
THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY 
69 
operating system. They have fewer peripherals. The machines them-
selves are sometimes slower than a comparable PC. If people made 
only rational decisions, and did all the research before making a 
purchase, no one would ever buy a Mac. But of course people do 
buy Macs. And some don't just buy them—they love them, a feeling 
that comes straight from the heart. Or the limbic brain. 
We all know someone who is a die-hard Mac lover. Ask them 
WHY they love their Mac. They won't tell you, "Well, I see myself as 
someone who likes to challenge the status quo, and it's important 
for me to surround myself with the people, products and brands 
that prove to the outside world who I believe I am." Biologically, 
that's what happened. But that decision was made in the part of the 
brain that controls behavior but not language. So they will provide a 
rationalization: "It's the user interface. It's the simplicity. It's the 
design. It's the high quality. They're the best computers. I'm a 
creative person." In reality, their purchase decision and their loyalty 
are deeply personal. They don't really care about Apple; it's all 
about them. 
The same can even be said for the people who love to work at 
Apple. Even employees can't put it into words. In their case, their 
job is one of the WHATs to their WHY. They too are convinced it's 
the quality of the products alone that is behind Apple's success. But 
deep inside, they all love being a part of something bigger than 
themselves. The most loyal Apple employees, like the most loyal 
Apple customers, all love a good revolution. A great raise and 
added benefits couldn't convince a loyal Apple employee to work 
for Dell, and no amount of cash-back incentives and rebates could 
convince a loyal Mac user to switch to a PC (many are already 
paying double the price). This is beyond rational. This is a belief. It's 
no accident that the culture at Apple is often described as a cult. It's 
more than just products, it's a cause to support. It's a matter of faith. 


--- Page 77 ---
START WITH WHY 
70 
Remember the Honda and the Ferrari? Products are not just 
symbols of what the company believes, they also serve as symbols 
of what the loyal buyers believe. People with Apple laptop com-
puters, for example, love opening them up while sitting in an air-
port. They like that everyone knows they are using a Mac. It's an 
emblem, a symbol of who they are. That glowing Apple logo speaks 
to something about them and how they see the world. Does anyone 
notice when someone pops open the lid of their HP or Dell 
computer? No! Not even the people using the computers care. HP 
and Dell have a fuzzy sense of WHY, so their products and their 
brands don't symbolize anything about the users. To the Dell or HP 
user, their computer, no matter how fast or sleek, is not a symbol of 
a higher purpose, cause or belief. It's just a computer. In fact, for the 
longest time, the logo on the lid of a Dell computer faced the user so 
when they opened it, it would be upside down for everyone else. 
Products with a clear sense of WHY give people a way to tell the 
outside world who they are and what they believe. Remember, 
people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it. If a 
company does not have a clear sense of WHY then it is impossible 
for the outside world to perceive anything more than WHAT the 
company does. And when that happens, manipulations that rely on 
pushing price, features, service or quality become the primary cur-
rency of differentiation.

Nature abhors a vacuum. In order to promote life, Mother Nature 
attempts to find balance whenever possible. When life is destroyed 
because of a forest fire, for example, nature will introduce new life to 
replace it. The existence of a food chain in any ecosystem, in which 
each animal exists as food for another, is a way of maintaining 
balance. The Golden Circle, grounded in natural principles of 
biology, obeys the need for balance as well. As I've discussed, when 
the WHY is absent, imbalance is produced and manipulations 
thrive. And when manipulations thrive, uncertainty increases for 
buyers, instability increases for sellers and stress increases for all. 
Starting with WHY is just the beginning. There is still work to be 
done before a person or an organization earns the right or ability to 
inspire. For The Golden Circle to work, each of the pieces must be in 
balance and in the right order. 
Clarity of WHY 
It all starts with clarity. You have to know WHY you do WHAT you 
do. If people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it, so 
it follows that if you don't know WHY you do WHAT you do, how 
will anyone else? If the leader of the organization can't clearly ar-
ticulate WHY the organization exists in terms beyond its products 
or services, then how does he expect the employees to know WHY 
to come to work? If a politician can't articulate WHY she seeks

public office beyond the standard "to serve the people" (the mini-
mum rational standard for all politicians), then how will the voters 
know whom to follow? Manipulations can motivate the outcome of 
an election, but they don't help choose who should lead. To lead 
requires those who willingly follow. It requires those who believe in 
something bigger than a single issue. To inspire starts with the 
clarity of WHY. 
Discipline of HOW 
Once you know WHY you do what you do, the question is HOW 
will you do it? HOWs are your values or principles that guide HOW 
to bring your cause to life. HOW we do things manifests in the 
systems and processes within an organization and the culture. Un-
derstanding HOW you do things and, more importantly, having the 
discipline to hold the organization and all its employees accountable 
to those guiding principles enhances an organization's ability to 
work to its natural strengths. Understanding HOW gives greater 
ability, for example, to hire people or find partners who will 
naturally thrive when working with you. 
Ironically, the most important question with the most elusive 
answer—WHY do you do what you do?—is actually quite simple 
and efficient to discover (and I'll share it in later chapters). It's the 
discipline to never veer from your cause, to hold yourself 
accountable to HOW you do things; that's the hardest part. Making 
it even more difficult for ourselves, we remind ourselves of our 
values by writing them on the wall... as nouns. Integrity. Honesty. 
Innovation. Communication, for example. But nouns are not 
actionable. They are things. You can't build systems or develop 
incentives around those things. It's nearly impossible to hold people 
accountable to nouns.

"A little more innovation today if you would please, Bob." And if 
you have to write "honesty" on your wall to remind you to do it, 
then you probably have bigger problems anyway. 
For values or guiding principles to be truly effective they have to 
be verbs. It's not "integrity," it's "always do the right thing." It's not 
"innovation," it's "look at the problem from a different angle." 
Articulating our values as verbs gives us a clear idea ... we have a 
clear idea of how to act in any situation. We can hold each other 
accountable to them measure them or even build incentives around 
them. Telling people to have integrity doesn't guarantee that their 
decisions will always keep customers' or clients' best interest in 
mind; telling them to always do the right thing does. I wonder what 
values Samsung had written on the wall when they developed that 
rebate that wasn't applicable to people living in apartment 
buildings. 
The Golden Circle offers an explanation for long-term success, 
but the inherent nature of doing things for the long term often 
includes investments or short-term costs. This is the reason the 
discipline to stay focused on the WHY and remain true to your 
values matters so much. 
Consistency of WHAT 
Everything you say and everything you do has to prove what 
you believe. A WHY is just a belief. That's all it is. HOWs are the 
actions you take to realize that belief. And WHATs are the results of 
those actions—everything you say and do: your products, services, 
marketing, PR, culture and whom you hire. If people don't buy 
WHAT you do but WHY you do it, then all these things must be 
consistent. With consistency people will see and hear, without a 
shadow of a doubt, what you believe. After all, we live in a tangible 
world. The only way people will know what you believe is by the 


--- Page 81 ---
START WITH WHY 
74 
things you say and do, and if you're not consistent in the things you 
say and do, no one will know what you believe. 
It is at the WHAT level that authenticity happens. "Authenticity" 
is that word so often bandied about in the corporate and political 
worlds. Everyone talks about the importance of being authentic. 
"You must be authentic," experts say. "All the trend data shows that 
people prefer to do business with authentic brands." "People vote for 
the authentic candidate." The problem is, that instruction is totally 
unactionable. 
How do you go into somebody's office and say, "From now on, 
please, a little more authenticity." "That marketing piece you're 
working on," a CEO might instruct, "please make it a little more 
authentic." What do companies do to make their marketing or their 
sales or whatever they're doing authentic? 
The common solution is hilarious to me. They go out and do 
customer research and they ask the customers, what would we have 
to tell you for us to be authentic? This entirely misses the point. You 
can't ask others what you have to do to be authentic. Being authentic 
means that you already know. What does a politician say when told 
to be "more authentic"? How does a leader act more "authentically"? 
Without a clear understanding of WHY, the instruction is 
completely useless. 
What authenticity means is that your Golden Circle is in balance. 
It means that everything you say and everything you do you actually 
believe. This goes for management as well as the employees. Only 
when that happens can the things you say and do be viewed as 
authentic. Apple believed that its original Apple computer and its 
Macintosh challenged the dominant IBM DOS platforms. Apple 
believes its iPod and iTunes products are challenging the status quo 
in the music industry. And we all understand WHY Apple does 
what it does. It is because of that mutual understanding that we 
view those Apple products as authentic. Dell introduced mp3

players and PDAs in an attempt to enter the small electronics 
business. We don't know what Dell's WHY is, we have no certainty 
about what the company believes or WHY it produced those prod-
ucts beyond self-gain and a desire to capitalize on a new market 
segment. Those products are not authentic. It's not that Dell couldn't 
enter other markets—it certainly has the knowledge and ability to 
make good products—but its ability to do so without a clear 
understanding of WHY is what makes it much harder and much 
more expensive. Just producing high-quality products and 
marketing them does not guarantee success. Authenticity cannot be 
achieved without clarity of WHY. And authenticity matters. 
Ask the best salesmen what it takes to be a great salesman. They 
will always tell you that it helps when you really believe in the 
product you're selling. What does belief have to do with a sales job? 
Simple. When salesmen actually believe in the thing they are selling, 
then the words that come out of their mouths are authentic. When 
belief enters the equation, passion exudes from the salesman. It is 
this authenticity that produces the relationships upon which all the 
best sales organizations are based. Relationships also build trust. 
And with trust comes loyalty. Absent a balanced Golden Circle 
means no authenticity, which means no strong relationships, which 
means no trust. And you're back at square one selling on price, 
service, quality or features. You are back to being like everyone else. 
Worse, without that authenticity, companies resort to manipulation: 
pricing, promotions, peer pressure, fear, take your pick. Effective? 
Of course, but only for the short term. 
Being authentic is not a requirement for success, but it is if you 
want that success to be a lasting success. Again, it goes back to 
WHY. Authenticity is when you say and do the things you actually 
believe. But if you don't know WHY the organization or the 
products exist on a level beyond WHAT you do, then it is 
impossible to know if the things you say or do are consistent with 


--- Page 83 ---
START WITH WHY 
76 
your WHY. Without WHY, any attempt at authenticity will almost 
always be inauthentic. 
The Right Order 
After you have clarity of WHY, are disciplined and accountable 
to your own values and guiding principles, and are consistent in all 
you say and do, the final step is to keep it all in the right order. Just 
like that little Apple marketing example I used earlier, simply 
changing the order of the information, starting with WHY, changed 
the impact of the message. The WHATs are important—they pro-
vide the tangible proof of the WHY—but WHY must come first. The 
WHY provides the context for everything else. As you will see over 
and over in all the cases and examples in this book, whether in 
leadership, decision-making or communication, starting with WHY 
has a profound and long-lasting impact on the result. Starting with 
WHY is what inspires people to act. 
If You Don't Know WHY, You Can't Know HOW 
Rollin King, a San Antonio businessman, hatched the idea to take 
what Pacific Southwest was doing in California and bring it to 
Texas—to start an airline that flew short-haul flights between Dallas, 
Houston and San Antonio. He had recently gone through a long and 
messy divorce and turned to the one man he trusted to help him get 
his idea off the ground. His Wild Turkey-drinking, chain-smoking 
divorce lawyer, Herb Kelleher. 
In nearly every way, King and Kelleher were opposites. King, a 
numbers guy, was notoriously gruff and awkward, while Kelleher 
was gregarious and likable. At first Kelleher called King's idea a 
dumb one, but by the end of the evening King had successfully 
inspired him with his vision and Kelleher agreed to consider coming 
on board. It would take four years, however, before Southwest

Airlines would make its first flight from Dallas's Love Field to 
Houston. 
Southwest did not invent the concept of a low-cost airline. Pacific 
Southwest Airlines pioneered the industry—Southwest even copied 
their name. Southwest had no first mover's advantage—Braniff In-
ternational Airways, Texas International Airlines and Continental 
Airlines were already serving the Texas market, and none was eager 
to give up any ground. But Southwest was not built to be an airline. 
It was built to champion a cause. They just happened to use an air-
line to do it. 
In the early 1970s, only 15 percent of the traveling population 
traveled by air. At that rate, the market was small enough to scare 
off most would-be competitors to the big airlines. But Southwest 
wasn't interested in competing against everyone else for 15 percent 
of the traveling population. Southwest cared about the other 85 
percent. Back then, if you asked Southwest whom their competition 
was, they would have told you, "We compete against the car and the 
bus." But what they meant was, "We're the champion for the 
common man." That was WHY they started the airline. That was 
their cause, their purpose, their reason for existing. HOW they went 
about building their company was not a strategy developed by a 
high-priced management consultancy. It wasn't a collection of best 
practices that they saw other companies doing. Their guiding 
principles and values stemmed directly from their WHY and were 
more common sense than anything else. 
In the 1970s, air travel was expensive, and if Southwest was 
going to be the champion for the common man, they had to be 
cheap. It was an imperative. And in a day and age when air travel 
was elitist—back then people wore ties on planes—as the champion 
for the common man, Southwest had to be fun. It was an imperative. 
In a time when air travel was complicated, with different prices 
depending on when you booked, Southwest had to be simple. If 


--- Page 85 ---
START WITH WHY 
78 
they were to be accessible to the other 85 percent, then simplicity 
was an imperative. At the time, Southwest had two price categories: 
nights/weekends and daytime. That was it. 
Cheap, fun and simple. That's HOW they did it. That's how they 
were to champion the cause of the common man. The result of their 
actions was made tangible in the things they said and did— their 
product, the people they hired, their culture and their marketing. 
"You are now free to move about the country," they said in their 
advertising. That's much more than a tagline. That's a cause. And 
it's a cause looking for followers. Those who could relate to 
Southwest, those who saw themselves as average Joes, now had an 
alternative to the big airlines. And those who believed what South- 
west believed became fiercely loyal to the company. They felt 
Southwest was a company that spoke directly to them and directly 
for them. More importantly, they felt that flying Southwest said 
something about who they were as people. The loyalty that devel-
oped with their customers had nothing to do with price. Price was 
simply one of the ways the airline brought their cause to life. 
Howard Putnam, one of the former presidents of Southwest, 
likes to tell a story of a senior executive of a large company who 
approached him after an event. The executive said he always flew 
one of the big airlines when he traveled on business. He had to, it 
was a company mandate. And although he had accumulated many 
frequent flier miles on the other airline and money was no object, 
when he flew for himself or with his family, he always flew South-
west. "He loves Southwest," Putnam says with a grin when he tells 
the story. Just because Southwest is cheap doesn't mean it only ap-
peals to those with less money. Cheap is just one of the things 
Southwest does that helps us understand what they believe. 
What Southwest has achieved is the stuff of business folklore. As 
a result of WHY they do what they do, and because they are highly 
disciplined in HOW they do it, they are the most profitable airline

79 
in history. There has never been a year that they didn't turn a profit, 
including after September 11 and during the oil crises of the 1970s 
and early 2000s. Everything Southwest says and does is authentic. 
Everything about them reflects the original cause King and Kelleher 
set out to champion decades earlier. It has never veered. 
Fast-forward about thirty years. United Airlines and Delta Air-
lines looked at the success of Southwest and decided they needed a 
low-cost product to compete and share in Southwest's success. "We 
got to get us one of those," they thought. In April 2003, Delta 
launched their low-cost alternative, Song. Less than a year later 
United launched Ted. In both cases, they copied HOW Southwest 
did it. They made Ted and Song cheap, fun and simple. And for 
anyone who ever flew Ted or Song, they were cheap, they were fun 
and they were simple. But both failed. 
United and Delta were both old hands in the airline business and 
were every bit qualified to add whatever products they wanted to 
adapt to market conditions or seize opportunities. The problem was 
not with WHAT they did, the problem was, no one knew WHY 
Song or Ted existed. They may have even been better than South-
west. But it didn't matter. Sure, people flew them, but there are 
always reasons people do business with you that have nothing to do 
with you. That people can be motivated to use your product is not 
the issue; the problem was that too few were loyal to the brands. 
Without a sense of WHY, Song and Ted were just another couple of 
airlines. Without a clear sense of WHY, all that people had to judge 
them on was price or convenience. They were commodities that had 
to rely on manipulations to build their businesses, an expensive 
proposition. United abandoned its entry into the low-cost airline 
business just four years after it began, and Delta's Song also took its 
last flight only four years after it launched. 
It is a false assumption that differentiation happens in HOW and 
WHAT you do. Simply offering a high-quality product with more 


--- Page 87 ---
START WITH WHY 
80 
features or better service or a better price does not create difference. 
Doing so guarantees no success. Differentiation happens in WHY 
and HOW you do it. Southwest isn't the best airline in the world. 
Nor are they always the cheapest. They have fewer routes than 
many of their competition and don't even fly outside the continental 
United States. WHAT they do is not always significantly better. But 
WHY they do it is crystal clear and everything they do proves it. 
There are many ways to motivate people to do things, but loyalty 
comes from the ability to inspire people. Only when the WHY is 
clear and when people believe what you believe can a true loyal 
relationship develop. 
Manipulation and Inspiration Are Similar, but Not the Same 
Manipulation and inspiration both tickle the limbic brain. 
Aspirational messages, fear or peer pressure all push us to decide 
one way or another by appealing to our irrational desires or playing 
on our fears. But it's when that emotional feeling goes deeper than 
insecurity or uncertainty or dreams that the emotional reaction 
aligns with how we view ourselves. It is at that point that behavior 
moves from being motivated to inspired. When we are inspired, the 
decisions we make have more to do with who we are and less to do 
with the companies or the products we're buying. 
When our decisions feel right, we're willing to pay a premium or 
suffer an inconvenience for those products or services. This has 
nothing to do with price or quality. Price, quality, features and ser-
vice are important, but they are the cost of entry in business today. It 
is those visceral limbic feelings that create loyalty. And it is that 
loyalty that gives Apple or Harley-Davidson or Southwest Airlines 
or Martin Luther King or any other great leader who commands a 
following such a huge advantage. Without a strong base of loyal 
followers, the pressure increases to manipulate—to compete or 


--- Page 88 ---
CLARITY, DISCIPLINE AND CONSISTENCY 
81 
"differentiate" based on price, quality, service or features. Loyalty, 
real emotional value, exists in the brain of the buyer, not the seller. 
It's hard to make a case to someone that your products or ser-
vices are important in their lives based on external rational factors 
that you have defined as valuable (remember the Ferrari versus the 
Honda). However, if your WHYs and their WHY correspond, then 
they will see your products and services as tangible ways to prove 
what they believe. When WHY, HOW, and WHAT are in balance, 
authenticity is achieved and the buyer feels fulfilled. When they are 
out of balance, stress or uncertainty exists. When that happens, the 
decisions we make will also be out of balance. Without WHY, the 
buyer is easily motivated by aspiration or fear. At that point, it is the 
buyer who is at the greatest risk of ending up being inauthentic. If 
they buy something that doesn't clearly embody their own sense of 
WHY, then those around them have little evidence to paint a clear 
and accurate picture of who they are. 
The human animal is a social animal. We're very good at sensing 
subtleties in behavior and judging people accordingly. We get good 
feelings and bad feelings about companies, just as we get good 
feelings and bad feelings about people. There are some people we 
just feel we can trust and others we just feel we can't. Those feelings 
also manifest when organizations try to court us. Our ability to feel 
one way or another toward a person or an organization is the same. 
What changes is who is talking to us, but it is always a single indi-
vidual who is listening. Even when a company airs its message on 
TV, for example, no matter how many people see the commercial, it 
is always and only an individual that can receive the message. This 
is the value of The Golden Circle; it provides a way to communicate 
consistent with how individuals receive information. For this reason 
an organization must be clear about its purpose, cause or belief and 
make sure that everything they say and do is consistent with and 
authentic to that belief. If the levels of The Golden Circle are in 


--- Page 89 ---
START WITH WHY 
82 
balance, all those who share the organization's view of the world 
will be drawn to it and its products like a moth to a light bulb. 
Doing Business Is Like Dating 
I'd like to introduce you to our imaginary friend Brad. Brad is 
going on a date tonight. It's a first date and he's pretty excited. He 
thinks the woman he's about to meet is really beautiful and that she 
makes a great prospect. Brad sits down for dinner and he starts 
talking. 
"I am extremely rich." 
"I have a big house and I drive a beautiful car." 
"I know lots of famous people." 
"I'm on TV all the time, which is good because I'm good- 
looking." 
"I've actually done pretty well for myself." 
The question is, does Brad get a second date? 
The way we communicate and the way we behave is all a matter of 
biology. That means we can make some comparisons between the 
things we do in our social lives and the things we do in our 
professional lives. After all, people are people. To learn how to 
apply. WHY to a business situation, you needn't look much farther 
than how we act on a date. Because, in reality, there is no difference 
between sales and dating. In both circumstances, you sit across a 
table from someone and hope to say enough of the right things to 
close the deal. Of course, you could always opt for a manipulation 
or two, a fancy dinner, dropping hints of tickets that you have or 
whom you know. Depending on how badly you want to close the 
deal, you could tell them anything they want to hear. Promise them 
the world and the odds are good that you will close the deal. Once. 


--- Page 90 ---
CLARITY, DISCIPLINE AND CONSISTENCY 
83 
Maybe twice. With time, however, maintaining that relationship 
will cost more and more. No matter the manipulations you choose, 
this is not the way to build a trusting relationship. 
In Brad's case, it is obvious that the date did not go well. The 
odds are not good that he will get a second date, and he's certainly 
not done a good job of laying down the foundation to build a rela-
tionship. Ironically, the woman's initial interest may have been gen-
erated based on those elements. She agreed to go on the date 
because her friends told her that Brad was good-looking and that he 
had a good job and that he knew a lot of famous people. Even 
though all those things may be true, WHATs don't drive decision-
making, WHATs should be used as proof of WHY, and the date 
plainly fell flat. 
Let's send Brad out again, but this time he's going to start with 
WHY. 
"You know what I love about my life?" he starts this time. "I get 
to wake up every day to do something I love. I get to inspire people 
to do the things that inspire them. It's the most wonderful thing in 
the world. In fact, the best part is trying to figure out all the dif-
ferent ways I can do that. It really is amazing. And believe it or not, 
I've actually been able to make a lot of money from it. I bought a big 
house and a nice car. I get to meet lots of famous people and I get to 
be on TV all the time, which is fun, because I'm good- looking. I'm 
very lucky that I'm doing something that I love, I've actually been 
able to do pretty well because of it." 
This time the chances Brad will get a second date, assuming that 
whoever is sitting across from him believes what he believes, went 
up exponentially. More importantly, he's also laying a good foun-
dation for a relationship, one based on values and beliefs. He said all 
the same things as on the first date; the only difference is he started 
with WHY, and all the WHATs, all the tangible benefits, served as 
proof of that WHY. 


--- Page 91 ---
START WITH WHY 
84 
Now consider how most companies do business. Someone sits 
down across a table from you, they've heard you're a good prospect, 
and they start talking. 
"Our company is extremely successful." 
"We have beautiful offices, you should stop by and check them 
out sometime." 
"We do business with all the biggest companies and brands." 
"I'm sure you've seen our advertising." 
"We're actually doing pretty well." 
In business, like a bad date, many companies work so hard to 
prove their value without saying WHY they exist in the first place. 
You'll have to do more than show your resume before someone 
finds you appealing, however. But that is exactly what companies 
do. They provide you with a long list of their experience—WHAT 
they've done, whom they know—all with the idea that you will find 
them so desirable that you will have to drop everything to do busi-
ness with them. 
People are people and the biology of decision-making is the same 
no matter whether it is a personal decision or a business decision. 
It's obvious that in the dating scenario it was a bad date, so why 
would we expect it to be any different in the business scenario? 
Like on a date, it is exceedingly difficult to start building a trusting 
relationship with a potential customer or client by trying to 
convince them of all the rational features and benefits. Those things 
are important, but they serve only to give credibility to a sales pitch 
and allow buyers to rationalize their purchase decision. As with all 
decisions, people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do 
it, and WHAT you do serves as the tangible proof of WHY you do it. 
But unless you start with WHY, all people have to go on are the 
rational benefits. And chances are you won't get a second date. 
Here's the alternative: 


--- Page 92 ---
CLARITY, DISCIPLINE AND CONSISTENCY 
85 
"You know what I love about our company? Every single one of 
us comes to work every day to do something we love. We get to 
inspire people to do the things that inspire them. It's the most won-
derful thing in the world. In fact, the fun part is trying to figure out 
all the different ways we can do that. It really is amazing. The best 
part is, it is also good for business. We do really well. We have beau-
tiful offices, you should stop by sometime to see. We work with 
some of the biggest companies. I'm sure you've seen our ads. We're 
actually doing pretty well." 
Now, how certain are you that the second pitch was better than 
the first? 
Three Degrees of Certainty 
When we can only provide a rational basis for a decision, when 
we can only point to tangible elements or rational measurements, 
the highest level of confidence we can give is, "I think this is the right 
decision." That would be biologically accurate because we're 
activating the neocortex, the "thinking" part of our brain. At a 
neocortical level we can verbalize our thoughts. This is what's hap-
pening when we spend all that time sifting through the pros and 
cons, listening to all the differences between plasma or LCD, Dell 
versus HP. 
When we make gut decisions, the highest level of confidence we 
can offer is, "The decision feels right," even if it flies in the face of all 
the facts and figures. Again, this is biologically accurate, because gut 
decisions happen in the part of the brain that controls our emotions, 
not language. Ask the most successful entrepreneurs and leaders 
what their secret is and invariably they all say the same thing: "I 
trust my gut." The times things went wrong, they will tell you, "I 
listened to what others were telling me, even though it didn't feel 
right. I should have trusted my gut." It's a good strategy, except it's 
not scalable. The gut decision can only be made by a single person. 


--- Page 93 ---
START WITH WHY 
86 
It's a perfectly good strategy for an individual or a small 
organization, but what happens when success necessitates that more 
people be able to make decisions that feel right? 
That's when the power of WHY can be fully realized. The ability 
to put a WHY into words provides the emotional context for deci-
sions. It offers greater confidence than "I think it's right." It's more 
scalable than "I feel it's right." When you know your WHY, the 
highest level of confidence you can offer is, "I know it's right." When 
you know the decision is right, not only does it feel right, but you can 
also rationalize it and easily put it into words. The decision is fully 
balanced. The rational WHATs offer proof for the feeling of WHY. If 
you can verbalize the feeling that drove the gut decision, if you can 
clearly state your WHY, you'll provide a clear context for those 
around you to understand why that decision was made. If the 
decision is consistent with the facts and figures, then those facts and 
figures serve to reinforce the decision—this is balance. And if the 
decision flies in the face of all the facts and figures then it will 
highlight the other factors that need to be considered. It can turn a 
controversial decision from a debate into a discussion. 
My former business partner, for example, would get upset when 
I turned away business. I would tell him that a potential client didn't 
"feel" right. That would frustrate him to no end because "the client's 
money was as good as everyone else's," he would tell me. He 
couldn't understand the reason for my decision and, worse, I 
couldn't explain it. It was just a feeling I had. In contrast, these days 
I can easily explain WHY I'm in business—to inspire people to do 
the things that inspire them. If I were to make the same decision 
now for the same gut reason, there is no debate because everyone is 
clear WHY the decision was made. We turn away business because 
those potential clients don't believe what we believe and they are not 
interested in anything to do with inspiring people. With a clear

discussion of whether the imbalance is worth the short-term gain

The goal of business should not be to do business with anyone 
who simply wants what you have. It should be to focus on the peo-
ple who believe what you believe. When we are selective about 
doing business only with those who believe in our WHY, trust 
emerges.

THE EMERGENCE OS TRUST 
To say that most of the company's employees were embarrassed 
to work there was an understatement. It was no secret that the em-
ployees felt mistreated. And if a company mistreats their people, just 
watch how the employees treat their customers. Mud rolls down a 
hill, and if you're the one standing at the bottom, you get hit with 
the full brunt. In a company, that's usually the customer. 
Throughout the 1980s, this was life at Continental Airlines—the 
worst airline in the industry. 
"I could see Continental's biggest problem the second I walked in 
the door in February of 1994," Gordon Bethune wrote in From Worst 
to First, the chief executive's firsthand account of Continental's 
turnaround. "It was a crummy place to work." Employees were 


--- Page 99 ---

92 
"surly to customers, surly to each other, and ashamed of their com-
pany. And you can't have a good product without people who like 
coming to work. It just can't be done," he recounts. 
Herb Kelleher, the head of Southwest for twenty years, was con-
sidered a heretic for positing the notion that it is a company's re-
sponsibility to look after the employees first. Happy employees 
ensure happy customers, he said. And happy customers ensure 
happy shareholders—in that order. Fortunately, Bethune shared this 
heretical belief. 
Some would argue that the reason Continental's culture was so 
poisonous was that the company was struggling. They would tell 
you that it's hard for executives to focus on anything other than 
survival when a company is facing hard times. "Once we get profit-
able again," the logic went, "then we will take a look at everything 
else." And without a doubt, throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, 
Continental struggled. The company filed for Chapter 11 bank-
ruptcy protection twice in eight years—once in 1983 and again in 
1991—and managed to go through ten CEOs in a decade. In 1994, 
the year Bethune took over as the newest CEO, the company had 
lost $600 million and ranked last in every measurable performance 
category. 
But all that didn't last long once Bethune arrived. The very next 
year Continental made $250 million and was soon ranked as one of 
the best companies to work for in America. And while Bethune 
made significant changes to improve the operations, the greatest 
gains were in a performance category that is nearly impossible to 
measure: trust. 
Trust does not emerge simply because a seller makes a rational 
case why the customer should buy a product or service, or because 
an executive promises change. Trust is not a checklist. Fulfilling all 
your responsibilities does not create trust. Trust is a feeling, not a 
rational experience. We trust some people and companies even 


--- Page 100 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
93 
when things go wrong, and we don't trust others even though ev-
erything might have gone exactly as it should have. A completed 
checklist does not guarantee trust. Trust begins to emerge when we 
have a sense that another person or organization is driven by things 
other than their own self-gain. 
With trust comes a sense of value—real value, not just value 
equated with money. Value, by definition, is the transference of 
trust. You can't convince someone you have value, just as you can't 
convince someone to trust you. You have to earn trust by commu-
nicating and demonstrating that you share the same values and 
beliefs. You have to talk about your WHY and prove it with WHAT 
you do. Again, a WHY is just a belief, HOWs are the actions we take 
to realize that belief, and WHATs are the results of those actions. 
When all three are in balance, trust is built and value is perceived. 
This is what Bethune was able to do. 
There are many talented executives with the ability to manage 
operations, but great leadership is not based solely on great opera-
tional ability. Leading is not the same as being the leader. Being the 
leader means you hold the highest rank, either by earning it, good 
fortune or navigating internal politics. Leading, however, means 
that others willingly follow you—not because they have to, not be-
cause they are paid to, but because they want to. Frank Lorenzo, 
CEO before Bethune, may have been the leader of Continental, but 
Gordon Bethune knew how to lead the company. Those who lead 
are able to do so because those who follow trust that the decisions 
made at the top have the best interest of the group at heart. In turn, 
those who trust work hard because they feel like they are working 
for something bigger than themselves. 
Prior to Bethune's arrival, the twentieth floor of the company's 
headquarters, the executive floor, was off-limits to most people. The 
executive suites were locked. Only those with a rank of senior vice 
president or higher were permitted to visit. Key cards were required 


--- Page 101 ---
START WITH WHY 
94 
to get onto the floor, security cameras were ubiquitous and armed 
guards roamed the floor to eliminate any doubt that the security was 
no joke. Clearly, the company suffered from trust issues. One story 
handed down was that Frank Lorenzo would not even drink a soda 
on a Continental plane if he didn't open the can himself. He didn't 
trust anyone, so it is no great leap of logic that no one trusted him. 
It's hard to lead when those whom you are supposed to be leading 
are not inclined to follow. 
Bethune was very different. He understood that beyond the 
structure and systems a company is nothing more than a collection 
of people. "You don't lie to your own doctor," he says, "and you 
can't lie to your own employees." Bethune set out to change the 
culture by giving everyone something they could believe in. And 
what, specifically, did he give them to believe in that could turn the 
worst airline in the industry into the best airline in the industry with 
all the same people and all the same equipment? 
In college I had a roommate named Howard Jeruchimowitz. 
Now an attorney in Chicago, Howard learned from an early age 
about a very simple human desire. Growing up in the suburbs of 
New York City, he played outfield on the worst team in the Little 
League. They lost nearly every game they played—and not by small 
margins either; they were regularly annihilated. Their coach was a 
good man and wanted to instill a positive attitude in the young 
athletes. After one of their more embarrassing losses, the coach 
pulled the team together and reminded them, "It doesn't matter who 
wins or loses, what matters is how you play the game." It was at this 
point that young Howard raised his hand and asked, "Then why do 
we keep score?" 
Howard understood from a very young age the very human 
desire to win. No one likes to lose, and most healthy people live 
their life to win. The only variation is the score we use. For some it's 
money, for others it's fame or awards. For some it's power, love, a 


--- Page 102 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
95 
family or spiritual fulfillment. The metric is relative, but the desire is 
the same. A billionaire doesn't need to work. Money becomes a way 
to keep score—a relative account of how things are going. Even a 
billionaire who loses millions due to poor decisions can get de-
pressed. Although the money may have zero impact on his lifestyle, 
no one likes to lose. 
The drive to win is not, per se, a bad thing. Problems arise, how-
ever, when the metric becomes the only measure of success, when 
what you achieve is no longer tied to WHY you set out to achieve it 
in the first place. 
Bethune set out to prove to everyone at Continental that if they 
wanted to win, they could win. And most of the employees stuck 
around to find out if he was right. There were a few exceptions. One 
executive who once held up a plane because he was running late 
was asked to leave, as were thirty-nine more of the top sixty 
executives who didn't believe. No matter how experienced they 
were or what they brought to the table, they were asked to leave if 
they weren't team players and weren't able to adapt to the new cul-
ture that Bethune was trying to build. There was no room for those 
who didn't believe in the new Continental. 
Bethune knew that building a team to go out and win meant 
more than giving a few rah-rah speeches and bonuses for the top 
brass if they hit certain revenue targets. He knew that if he wanted 
to build a real, lasting success, people had to win not for him, not 
for the shareholders and not even for the customer. For the success 
to last the employees of Continental had to want to win for 
themselves. 
Everything he talked about was in terms of how it benefited the 
employees. Instead of telling them to keep the planes clean for cus-
tomers, he pointed out something more obvious. Every day they 
came to work on a plane. The passengers left after their flight, but 


--- Page 103 ---
START WITH WHY 
96 
many of the flight attendants had to stay on for at least one more 
trip. It's just nicer to come to work when the environment is cleaner. 
Bethune also got rid of all the security on the twentieth floor. He 
instituted an open-door policy and made himself incredibly 
accessible. It was common for him to show up and sling bags with 
some of the baggage handlers at the airport. From now on, this was 
a family and everyone had to work together. 
Bethune focused on the things they knew to be important, and to an 
airline the most important thing is to get the planes running on time. 
In the early 1990s, before Bethune arrived, Continental had the 
lowest on-time rating of the nation's ten largest airlines. So Bethune 
told employees that each month Continental's on-time percentage 
ranked in the top five, every employee would receive a check for 
$65. When you consider that Continental had 40,000 employees in 
1995, every on-time month cost the airline a whopping $2.5 million, 
But Bethune knew he was getting a deal: being chronically late was 
costing it $5 million a month in expenses like missed connections 
and putting passengers up overnight. But most important to 
Bethune was what the bonus program did for the com- pany 
culture: it got tens of thousands of employees, including managers, 
all pointed in the same direction for the first time in years. 
Gone were the days when only the brass would enjoy the ben-
efits of success. Everyone got their $65 when the airline did well and 
no one got it when the airline missed its targets. Bethune even 
insisted that a separate check be sent out. It wasn't just added to 
their salary check. This was different. This was a symbol of winning. 
And on every check a message reminded them WHY they came to 
work: "Thank you for helping make Continental one of the best." 
"We measured things the employees could truly control," Be-
thune said. "We made the stakes something the employees would 
win or lose on together, not separately."

Everything they did made people feel like they were in it 
together. And they were. 
The Only Difference Between You and a 
Caveman Is the Car You Drive 
 
The reason the human race has been so successful is not because 
we're the strongest animals—far from it. Size and might alone do 
not guarantee success. We've succeeded as a species because of our 
ability to form cultures. Cultures are groups of people who come 
together around a common set of values and beliefs. When we share 
values and beliefs with others, we form trust. Trust of others allows 
us to rely on others to help protect our children and ensure our 
personal survival. The ability to leave the den to hunt or explore 
with confidence that the community will protect your family and 
your stuff until you return is one of the most important factors in 
the survival of an individual and the advancement of our species. 
That we trust people with common values and beliefs is not, in 
itself, a profound assertion. There is a reason we're not friends with 
everyone we meet. We're friends with people who see the world the 
way we see it, who share our views and our belief set. No matter 
how good a match someone looks on paper, that doesn't guarantee a 
friendship. You can think of it on a macro scale also. The world is 
filled with different cultures. Being American is not better than 
being French. They are just different cultures—not better or worse, 
just different. American culture strongly values ideals of 
entrepreneurship, independence and self-reliance. We call our 
WHY—the American Dream. French culture strongly values ideals 
of unified identity, group reliance and joie de vivre. (Notice that we 
use the French word to describe the joy-of-life lifestyle. Coinci-
dence? Perhaps.) Some people are good fits in French culture and 


--- Page 105 ---
START WITH WHY 
98 
some people are good fits in American culture. It is not a matter of 
better or worse, they are just different. 
Most people who are born and raised in one culture will, for 
obvious reasons, end up being a reasonably good fit in that culture, 
but not always. There are people who grew up in France who never 
quite felt like they belonged; they were misfits in their own culture. 
So they moved, maybe to America. Drawn to the feelings they had 
for America's WHY, they followed the American Dream and 
emigrated. 
It is always said that America is fueled in large part by immi-
grants. But it is completely false that all immigrants make produc-
tive members of a society. It's not true that all immigrants have an 
entrepreneurial spirit—just the ones that are viscerally drawn to 
America. That's what a WHY does. When it is clearly understood, it 
attracts people who believe the same thing. And assuming they are 
good fits for what Americans believe and how they do things, those 
immigrants will say of America, "I love it here," or "I love this 
country." This visceral reaction has less to do with America and 
more to do with them. It's how they feel about their own opportu-
nity and their own ability to thrive in a culture in which they feel 
like they belong versus the one they came from. 
And within the big WHY that is America, it breaks down even 
further. Some people are better fits in New York and some are better 
fits in Minneapolis. One culture is not better or worse than the other, 
they are just different. Many people dream of moving to New York, 
for example, attracted to the glamour or the perception of 
opportunity. They arrive with aspirations of making it big, but they 
fail to consider whether they will fit into the culture before they 
make their move. Some make it. But so many don't. Over and over, 
I've seen people come to New York with big hopes and dreams, but 
either couldn't find the job they wanted or they found it but couldn't 
take the pressure. They are not dumb or bad or poor workers. They 


--- Page 106 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
99 
were just bad fits. They either stay in New York and exert more 
effort than they need to, hating their jobs and their lives, or they 
move. If they move to a city in which they are better fits— Chicago 
or San Francisco or somewhere else—they often end up much 
happier and more successful. New York is not rationally better than 
other cities, it's just not right for everyone. Like all cities, it's only 
right for those who are good fits. 
The same can be said for any place that has a strong culture or 
recognizable personality. We do better in cultures in which we are 
good fits. We do better in places that reflect our own values and 
beliefs. Just as the goal is not to do business with anyone who sim-
ply wants what you have, but to do business with people who be-
lieve what you believe, so too is it beneficial to live and work in a 
place where you will naturally thrive because your values and be-
liefs align with the values and beliefs of that culture. 
Now consider what a company is. A company is a culture. A 
group of people brought together around a common set of values 
and beliefs. It's not products or services that bind a company to-
gether. It's not size and might that make a company strong, it's the 
culture—the strong sense of beliefs and values that everyone, from 
the CEO to the receptionist, all share. So the logic follows, the goal is 
not to hire people who simply have a skill set you need, the goal is 
to hire people who believe what you believe. 
Finding the People Who Believe What You Believe 
Early in the twentieth century, the English adventurer Ernest Shack- 
leton set out to explore the Antarctic. Roald Amundsen, a Norwe- 
gian, had only just become the first explorer ever to reach the South 
Pole, leaving one remaining conquest: the crossing of the continent 
via the southernmost tip of the earth. 
The land part of the expedition would start at the frigid Weddell 
Sea, below South America, and travel 1,700 miles across the pole to 


--- Page 107 ---
START WITH WHY 
100 
the Ross Sea, below New Zealand. The cost, Shackleton estimated at 
the time, would be about $250,000. "The crossing of the south polar 
continent will be the biggest polar journey ever attempted," 
Shackleton told a reporter for the New York Times on December 29, 
1913. "The unknown fields in the world which are still unconquered 
are narrowing down, but there still remains this great work." 
On December 5, 1914, Shackleton and a crew of twenty-seven 
men set out for the Weddell Sea on the Endurance, a 350-ton ship 
that had been constructed with funds from private donors, the 
British government and the Royal Geographical Society. By then, 
World War I was raging in Europe, and money was growing more 
scarce. Donations from English schoolchildren paid for the dog 
teams. 
But the crew of the Endurance would never reach the continent of 
Antarctica. 
Just a few days out of South Georgia Island in the southern 
Adantic, the ship encountered mile after mile of pack ice, and was 
soon trapped as winter moved in early and with fury. Ice closed in 
around the ship "like an almond in a piece of toffee," a crew member 
wrote. Shackleton and his crew were stranded in the Antarctic for 
ten months as the Endurance drifted slowly north, until the pressure 
of the ice floes finally crushed the ship. On November 21, 1915, the 
crew watched as she sank in the frigid waters of the Weddell Sea. 
Stranded on the ice, the crew of the Endurance boarded their 
three lifeboats and landed on tiny Elephant Island. There Shackleton 
left behind all but five of his men and embarked on a hazardous 
journey across 800 miles of rough seas to find help. Which, eventu-
ally, they did. 
What makes the story of the Endurance so remarkable, however, is 
not the expedition, it's that throughout the whole ordeal no one 
died, There were no stories of people eating others and no mutiny. 


--- Page 108 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
101 
This was not luck. This was because Shackleton hired good fits. 
He found the right men for the job. When you fill an organization 
with good fits, those who believe what you believe, success just 
happens. And how did Shackleton find this amazing crew? With a 
simple ad in the London Times. 
Compare that to how we hire people. Like Shackleton, we run 
ads in the newspaper, or on the modern equivalents, Craigslist or 
Monster.com. Sometimes we hire a recruiter to find someone for us, 
but the process is largely the same. We provide a list of qualifica-
tions for the job and expect that the best candidate will be the one 
who meets those requirements. 
The issue is how we write those ads. They are all about WHAT 
and not about WHY. A want ad might say, for example, "Account 
executive needed, minimum five years' experience, must have 
working knowledge of industry. Come work for a fantastic, fast-
growing company with great pay and great benefits." The ad may 
produce loads of applicants, but how do we know which is the right 
fit? 
Shackleton's ad for crew members was different. His did not say 
WHAT he was looking for. His ad did not say: 
"Men needed for expedition. Minimum five years' experience. 
Must know how to hoist mainsail. Come work for a fantastic 
captain." 
Rather, Shackleton was looking for those with something more. 
He was looking for a crew that belonged on such an expedition. His 
actual ad ran like this: 
"Men wanted for Hazardous journey. Small wages, bitter cold, 
long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return 
doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success." 
The only people who applied for the job were those who read the ad 
and thought it sounded great. They loved insurmountable odds. The 
only people who applied for the job were survivors. Shackleton 


--- Page 109 ---
START WITH WHY 
102 
hired only people who believed what he believed. Their ability to 
survive was guaranteed. When employees belong, they will 
guarantee your success. And they won't be working hard and 
looking for innovative solutions for you, they will be doing it for 
themselves. 
What all great leaders have in common is the ability to find good 
fits to join their organizations—those who believe what they believe. 
Southwest Airlines is a great example of a company with a knack for 
hiring good fits. Their ability to find people who embody their cause 
makes it much easier for them to provide great service. As Herb 
Kelleher famously said, "You don't hire for skills, you hire for 
attitude. You can always teach skills." This is all fine and good; the 
problem is, which attitude? What if their attitude is not one that fits 
your culture? 
I love asking companies whom they like to hire, and one of the 
most common answers I am given is, "We hire only passionate 
people." But how do you know if someone is passionate for inter-
viewing, but not so passionate for working? The truth is, almost 
every person on the planet is passionate, we are just not all pas-
sionate for the same things. Starting with WHY when hiring dra-
matically increases your ability to attract those who are passionate 
for what you believe. Simply hiring people with a solid resume or 
great work ethic does not guarantee success. The best engineer at 
Apple, for example, would likely be miserable if he worked at Mi-
crosoft. Likewise, the best engineer at Microsoft would probably not 
thrive at Apple. Both are highly experienced and work hard. Both 
may come highly recommended. However, each engineer does not 
fit the culture of the other's company. The goal is to hire those who 
are passionate for your WHY, your purpose, cause or belief, and 
who have the attitude that fits your culture. Once that is established, 
only then should their skill set and experience be evaluated. 
Shackleton could have had the most experienced crew money could 


--- Page 110 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
103 
buy, but if they weren't able to connect on a level much deeper than 
their ability, their survival would not have been a foregone 
conclusion. 
For years, Southwest didn't have a complaints department— they 
didn't need one. Though Kelleher rightly talked about the need to 
hire for attitude, the airline in fact deserves more credit for hiring 
the good fits responsible for providing great service. Kelleher was 
not the only one making the hiring decisions, and asking everyone 
to simply trust their gut is too risky. Their genius came from 
figuring out why some people were such good fits and then devel-
oping systems to find more of them. 
In the 1970s, Southwest Airlines decided to put their flight at-
tendants in hot pants and go-go boots as part of their uniforms (hey, 
it was the 1970s). It wasn't their idea; Pacific Southwest, the 
California-based airline after which Southwest modeled itself, did it 
first, Southwest simply copied them. Unlike Pacific Southwest, 
however, Southwest figured out something that would prove in-
valuable. They realized that when they recruited flight attendants, 
the only people who applied for the job were cheerleaders and 
majorettes. That's because they were the only people who didn't 
mind wearing the new uniforms. Cheerleaders and majorettes, 
however, fit in perfectly at Southwest. They didn't just have a great 
attitude, their whole disposition was about cheering people on. 
Spreading optimism. Leading crowds to believe that "we can win." 
They were perfect fits at a company that was the champion of the 
common man. Realizing this, Southwest started to recruit only 
cheerleaders and majorettes. 
Great companies don't hire skilled people and motivate them, 
they hire already motivated people and inspire them. People are 
either motivated or they are not. Unless you give motivated people 
something to believe in, something bigger than their job to work 


--- Page 111 ---

104 
toward, they will motivate themselves to find a new job and you'll 
be stuck with whoever's left. 
Give 'Em a Cathedral 
Consider the story of two stonemasons. You walk up to the first 
stonemason and ask, "Do you like your job?" He looks up at you and 
replies, "I've been building this wall for as long as I can remember. 
The work is monotonous. I work in the scorching hot sun all day. 
The stones are heavy and lifting them day after day can be 
backbreaking. I'm not even sure if this project will be completed in 
my lifetime. But it's a job. It pays the bills." You thank him for his 
time and walk on. 
About thirty feet away, you walk up to a second stonemason. 
You ask him the same question, "Do you like your job?" He looks up 
and replies, "I love my job. I'm building a cathedral. Sure, I've been 
working on this wall for as long as I can remember, and yes, the 
work is sometimes monotonous. I work in the scorching hot sun all 
day. The stones are heavy and lifting them day after day can be 
backbreaking. I'm not even sure if this project will be completed in 
my lifetime. But I'm building a cathedral." 
WHAT these two stonemasons are doing is exactly the same; the 
difference is, one has a sense of purpose. He feels like he belongs. 
He comes to work to be a part of something bigger than the job he's 
doing. Simply having a sense of WHY changes his entire view of his 
job. It makes him more productive and certainly more loyal. 
Whereas the first stonemason would probably take another job for 
more pay, the inspired stonemason works longer hours and would 
probably turn down an easier, higher-paying job to stay and be a 
part of the higher cause. The second stonemason does not see him-
self as any more or less important than the guy making the stained 
glass windows or even the architect. They are all working together 
to build the cathedral. It is this bond that creates camaraderie. And 


--- Page 112 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
105 
that camaraderie and trust is what brings success. People working 
together for a common cause. 
Companies with a strong sense of WHY are able to inspire their 
employees. Those employees are more productive and innovative, 
and the feeling they bring to work attracts other people eager to 
work there as well. It's not such a stretch to see why the companies 
that we love to do business with are also the best employers. When 
people inside the company know WHY they come to work, people 
outside the company are vastly more likely to understand WHY the 
company is special. In these organizations, from the management on 
down, no one sees themselves as any more or any less than anyone 
else. They all need each other. 
When Motivated by WHY, Success Just Happens 
It was a turn-of-the-century version of the dot-com boom. The 
promise of a revolutionary new technology was changing the way 
people imagined the future. And there was a race to see who could 
do it first. It was the end of the nineteenth century and the new 
technology was the airplane. One of the best-known men in the field 
was Samuel Pierpont Langley. Like many other inventors of his day, 
he was attempting to build the world's first heavier-than- air flying 
machine. The goal was to be the first to achieve machine- powered, 
controlled, manned flight. The good news was Langley had all the 
right ingredients for the enormous task; he had, what most would 
define as, the recipe for success. 
Langley had achieved some renown within the academic com-
munity as an astronomer, which earned him high-ranking and 
prestigious positions. He was secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. He had been an assistant in the Harvard College Observatory 
and professor of mathematics at the United States Naval Academy. 
Langley was very well connected. His friends included some of the 
most powerful men in government and business, including Andrew 


--- Page 113 ---
START WITH WHY 
106 
Carnegie and Alexander Graham Bell. He was also extremely well 
funded. The War Department, the precursor the Department of 
Defense, had given him $50,000 for the project, a lot of money in 
those days. Money was no object. 
Langley assembled some of the best and brightest minds of the 
day. His dream team included test pilot Charles Manly, a brilliant 
Cornell-trained mechanical engineer, and Stephan Balzer, the de-
veloper of the first car in New York. Langley and his team used the 
finest materials. The market conditions were perfect and his PR was 
great. The New York Times followed him around everywhere. 
Everyone knew Langley and was rooting for his success. 
But there was a problem. 
Langley had a bold goal, but he didn't have a clear sense of 
WHY. His purpose for wanting to build the plane was defined in 
terms of WHAT he was doing and WHAT he could get. He had had 
a passion for aeronautics since a very young age, but he did not 
have a cause to champion. More than anything else, Langley 
wanted to be first. He wanted to be rich and he wanted to be 
famous. That was his driving motivation. 
Although already well regarded in his own field, he craved the 
kind of fame of a Thomas Edison or Alexander Graham Bell, the 
kind that comes only with inventing something big. Langley saw 
the airplane as his ticket to fame and fortune. He was smart and 
motivated. He had what we still assume is the recipe for success: 
plenty of cash, the best people and ideal market conditions. But few 
of us have ever heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley. 
A few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio, Orville and Wilbur 
Wright were also building a flying machine. Unlike Langley, the 
Wright brothers did not have the recipe for success. Worse, they 
seemed to have the recipe for failure. There was no funding for their 
venture. No government grants. No high-level connections. The 
Wright brothers funded their dream with the proceeds from their 


--- Page 114 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
107 
bicycle shop. Not a single person working on the team, including 
Orville and Wilbur, had a college education; some did not even fin-
ish high school. What the Wright brothers were doing wasn't any 
different from Langley or all the others trying to build a flying ma-
chine. But the Wright brothers did have something very special. 
They had a dream. They knew WHY it was important to build this 
thing. They believed that if they could figure out this flying ma-
chine, it would change the world. They imagined the benefits to 
everyone else if they were successful. 
"Wilbur and Orville were true scientists, deeply and genuinely 
concerned about the physical problem they were trying to solve— 
the problem of balance and flight," said James Tobin, the Wright 
brothers' biographer. Langley, on the other hand, was consumed 
with acquiring the level of prestige of his associates like Alexander 
Graham Bell, fame that he knew would come only with a major sci-
entific breakthrough. Langley, Tobin said, "did not have the 
Wrights' passion for flight, but rather was looking for achievement." 
Orville and Wilbur preached what they believed and inspired 
others in the community to join them in their cause. The proof of 
their commitment was self-evident. With failure after failure, most 
would have given up, but not the Wright brothers' team. The team 
was so inspired that no matter how many setbacks they suffered 
they would show up for more. Every time the Wright brothers went 
out to make a test flight, so the stories go, they would take five sets 
of parts with them, because they knew that's how many times they 
were likely to fail before deciding to come home for the day. 
Then it happened. On December 17, 1903, on a field in Kitty 
Hawk, North Carolina, the Wright brothers took to the sky. A fifty- 
nine-second flight at an altitude of 120 feet at the speed of a jog was 
all it took to usher in a new technology that would change the 
world.

108 
Remarkable as the achievement was, it went relatively 
unnoticed. The New York Times was not there to cover the story. 
Driven by something bigger than fame and glory, the Wright 
brothers were content to wait to tell the world. They understood its 
true significance to the world. 
What Langley and the Wright brothers were trying to create was 
exactly the same; both were building the same product. Both the 
Wright brothers and Langley were highly motivated. Both had a 
strong work ethic. Both had keen scientific minds. What the Wright 
brothers' team had that Langley did wasn't luck. It was inspiration. 
One was motivated by the prospect of fame and wealth, the other by 
a belief. The Wright brothers excited the human spirit of those 
around them. Langley paid for talent to help him get rich and 
famous. The Wright brothers started with WHY. Further proof 
Langley was motivated by WHAT, a few days after Orville and Wil-
bur took flight, Langley quit. He got out of the business. He could 
have said, "That's amazing, now I'm going to improve upon their 
technology." But he didn't. He found the defeat humiliating—his 
own test flight had landed in the Potomac River, and the newspa-
pers all made fun of him. He cared so much about what others 
thought of him, he was so preoccupied with becoming famous. He 
wasn't first, so he simply quit. 
Innovation Happens at the Edges 
Dream teams are not always so dreamy. When a team of experts 
comes together they often work for themselves and not for the good 
of the whole. This is what happens when companies feel the need to 
pay mega-salaries to "get the best talent." Those people are not 
necessarily showing up because they believe in your WHY, they are 
showing up for the money. A classic manipulation. Paying someone 
a lot of money and asking them to come up with great ideas ensures 
very little. However, pulling together a team of like- minded people 


--- Page 116 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
109 
and giving them a cause to pursue ensures a greater sense of 
teamwork and camaraderie. Langley pulled together a dream team 
and promised them riches. The Wright brothers inspired a group of 
people to join them in pursuit of something bigger than each 
member of the team. Average companies give their people 
something to work on. In contrast, the most innovative or-
ganizations give their people something to work toward. 
The role of a leader is not to come up with all the great ideas. The 
role of a leader is to create an environment in which great ideas can 
happen. It is the people inside the company, those on the front lines, 
who are best qualified to find new ways of doing things. The people 
who answer the phones and talk to customers, for example, can tell 
you more about the kinds of questions they get than can anyone 
sitting in an executive suite miles away. If the people inside a 
company are told to come to work and just do their job, that's all 
they will do. If they are constantly reminded WHY the company 
was founded and told to always look for ways to bring that cause to 
life while performing their job, however, then they will do more 
than their job. 
Steve Jobs, for example, did not personally come up with the iPod or 
iTunes or the iPhone. Others inside the company did. Jobs gave 
people a filter, a context, a higher purpose around which to 
innovate: find existing status-quo industries, those in which com-
panies fight to protect their old-fashioned business models, and 
challenge them. This is WHY Apple was founded, it is what Jobs 
and Wozniak did when they started the company, and it is what 
Apple's people and products have done ever since. It's a repeating 
pattern. Apple's employees simply look for ways to bring their cause 
to life in as many places as they can. And it works. 
It is not the same at many other companies. Companies that 
define themselves by WHAT they do instead of WHY they do it 
instruct their people to be innovative around a product or service. 


--- Page 117 ---
START WITH WHY 
110 
"Make it better," they are instructed. Those who work for Apple's 
competitors, companies that have defined themselves as "computer 
manufacturers," come to work to develop "more innovative" com-
puters. The best they can do is add more RAM, add a feature or two, 
or, as one PC maker has done, give people the option to customize 
the color of their computer casing. This hardly qualifies as an idea 
with the potential to change the course of an industry. A nice 
feature, for sure, but not innovation. If you are curious as to how 
Colgate finds itself with thirty-two different types of toothpaste 
today, it is because every day its people come to work to develop a 
better toothpaste and not, for example, to look for ways to help 
people feel more confident about themselves. 
Apple does not have a lock on good ideas; there are smart, in-
novative thinkers at most companies. But great companies give their 
people a purpose or challenge around which to develop ideas rather 
than simply instruct them to make a better mousetrap. Companies 
that study their competitors in hopes of adding the features and 
benefits that will make their products "better" are only working to 
entrench the company in WHAT it does. Companies with a clear 
sense of WHY tend to ignore their competition, whereas those with 
a fuzzy sense of WHY are obsessed with what others are doing. 
The ability of a company to innovate is not just useful for de-
veloping new ideas, it is invaluable for navigating struggle. When 
people come to work with a higher sense of purpose, they find it 
easier to weather hard times or even to find opportunity in those 
hard times. People who come to work with a clear sense of WHY are 
less prone to giving up after a few failures because they understand 
the higher cause. Thomas Edison, a man definitely driven by a 
higher cause, said, "I didn't find a way to make a light bulb, I found 
a thousand ways how not to make one." 
Southwest Airlines is famous for pioneering the ten-minute 
turnaround—the ability to deplane, prep, and board a plane in ten 


--- Page 118 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
111 
minutes. This ability helps an airline make more money, because the 
more the planes are in the sky, the better the company is doing. 
What few people realize is that this innovation was born out of 
struggle. In 1971, Southwest was running low on cash and needed to 
sell one of their aircraft to stay in business. This left them with three 
planes to fly a schedule that required four. They had two choices: 
they could scale back their operations, or they could figure out how 
to turn their planes around in ten minutes. And thus was born the 
ten-minute turnaround. 
Whereas most other airline employees would have simply said it 
couldn't be done, Southwest's people rallied to figure out how to 
perform the unprecedented and seemingly impossible task. Today, 
their innovation is still paying dividends. Because of increased 
airport congestion and larger planes and cargo loads, Southwest 
now takes about twenty-five minutes to turn their planes around. 
However, if they were to try to keep the same schedule but add 
even five minutes to the turnaround time, they would need an 
additional eighteen planes in their fleet at a cost of nearly a billion 
dollars. 
Southwest's remarkable ability to solve problems, Apple's re-
markable knack for innovation and the Wright brothers' ability to 
develop a technology with the team they had were all possible for 
the same reason: they believed they could and they trusted their 
people to do it. 
The Definition of Trust 
Founded by Sir Francis Baring in 1762, Barings Bank was the oldest 
merchant bank in England. The bank, which survived the Napole-
onic Wars, World War I and World War II, was unable to survive 
the predilection for risk of one self-proclaimed rogue trader. Nick 
Leeson single-handedly brought down Barings Bank in 1995 by 
performing some unauthorized, extremely high-risk trades. Had the 
proverbial winds continued to blow in the right direction, Leeson 


--- Page 119 ---
START WITH WHY 
112 
would have made himself and the bank extremely rich and he 
would have been hailed as a hero. 
But such is the nature of unpredictable things like the weather 
and financial markets. Few dispute that what Leeson was doing was 
anything more than gambling. And gambling is very different from 
calculated risk. Calculated risk accepts that there can be great loses, 
but steps are taken to either guard against or respond to an unlikely 
but possible outcome. Even though an emergency landing on water 
is "unlikely," as the airlines tell us, they still provide us lifejackets. 
And if only for peace of mind, we're glad they do. To do otherwise 
is a gamble few airlines would be willing to take, even though the 
actuarial tables are heavily weighted on their side. 
Leeson strangely held two positions at Barings, ostensibly serv-
ing as both a trader and his own supervisor, but that fact is not 
interesting given the subject matter. That one man had such a tol-
erance for risk that he could create so much damage is not very 
interesting either. Both of those are short-term factors. Both would 
have ended if Leeson had either left the company or changed jobs, 
or if Barings had assigned a new supervisor to oversee his opera-
tions. What is more interesting is the culture at the bank that could 
allow these conditions to exist in the first place. Barings had lost its 
WHY. 
The culture at Barings was no longer one in which people came 
to work inspired. Motivated, yes, but not inspired. Manipulated by 
the promise of massive payouts for performance, for sure, but not 
inspired to work in the best interest of the whole. As Leeson re- 
ported in his own account of how he got away with such risky be-
havior for so long, he said it was not that others didn't recognize 
that what he was doing was potentially dangerous. It was worse 
than that. There was a stigma against speaking out. "People at the 
London end of Barings," Leeson explained, "were all so know-all 
that nobody dared ask a stupid question in case they looked silly in 


--- Page 120 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
113 
front of everyone else." The lack of a clear set of values and beliefs, 
along with the weak culture that resulted, created the conditions for 
an every-man-for-himself environment, the long-term impact of 
which could yield little else than disaster. This is caveman stuff. If 
the people aren't looking out for the community, then the benefits of 
a community erode. Many companies have star employees and star 
salesmen and so on, but few have a culture that produces great 
people as a rule and not an exception. 
Trust is a remarkable thing. Trust allows us to rely on others. We 
rely on those we trust for advice to help us make decisions. Trust is 
the bedrock for the advancement of our own lives, our families, our 
companies, our societies and our species. We trust those in our 
community to care for our children so we can go out to dinner. 
Given the choice between two babysitters, we're more likely to trust 
a babysitter with a little experience from the neighborhood than one 
with lots of experience from far away. We wouldn't trust someone 
from the outside because we don't know anything about them, we 
say. The reality is, we don't know anything about the local 
babysitter either, beyond the fact that she's from the neighborhood. 
In this case, we trust familiarity over experience with something 
quite important—the safety of our children. We trust that someone 
who lives in the community and more likely shares our values and 
beliefs is better qualified to care for the most valuable thing in our 
lives over someone with a long resume but from an unfamiliar 
place. That's pretty remarkable. It causes some pause when we con-
sider how we hire people: what's more important, their resume and 
experience, or whether they will fit our community? Our children 
are probably more important than the position we want to fill at the 
organization, yet we seem to exercise a very different standard. 
Is there a false assumption at play here as to who makes the best 
employee? 


--- Page 121 ---
START WITH WHY 
114 
Historically, trust has played a bigger role in advancing compa-
nies and societies than skill set alone. Like the couple leaving their 
children while they go out on a date for the evening, groups from 
within a society would go off with confidence, knowing that their 
homes and families would be safe upon their return. If there were 
no trust, then no one would take risks. No risks would mean no 
exploration, no experimentation and no advancement of the society 
as a whole. That's a remarkable concept: only when individuals can 
trust the culture or organization will they take personal risks in 
order to advance that culture or organization as a whole. For no 
other reason than, in the end, it's good for their own personal health 
and survival. 
No matter how experienced, no matter how proficient, a trapeze 
artist will not attempt a totally new death-defying leap without first 
trying it with a net below him. And depending on how death- 
defying the trick is, he may insist on always having a net when per-
forming the trick. Besides its obvious advantage of catching you if 
you fall, the net also provides a psychological benefit. Knowing it is 
there gives the trapeze artist the confidence to try something he's 
never done before, or to do it again and again. Remove the net and 
he will only do the safe tricks, the ones he knows he can land. The 
more he trusts the quality of the net, the more he will take personal 
risks to make his act better. The trust the circus management gives 
him by providing him a net is probably afforded to other performers 
too. Soon all the performers will feel confident to try new things and 
push themselves further. That collection of personal confidence and 
personal risk results in the entire circus putting on a much better 
show. An overall better show means more customers. And the 
system thrives. But not without trust. For those within a community, 
or an organization, they must trust that their leaders provide a net—
practical or emotional. With that feeling of support, those in the 


--- Page 122 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
115 
organization are more likely to put in extra effort that ultimately 
benefits the group as a whole. 
I will admit that there are always those who will take the risk, for 
the first time or repeatedly, without the net. There will always be 
those who will explore regardless of who is home holding down the 
fort. These people sometimes earn their rightful spots as the 
innovators. The ones who pushed further, the ones who did things 
no one else would do. Some of them may advance a business or 
even society. And some of them end up dead before they achieve 
anything. 
There is big a difference between jumping out of a plane with a 
parachute on and jumping without one. Both produce extraordinary 
experiences, but only one increases the likelihood of being able to 
try again another time. A trapeze artist with a personality 
predisposed to taking extraordinary risks without a net may be the 
star attraction in an otherwise mediocre show. But if he dies or 
leaves for another circus, then what? This is the paradigm in which 
someone is motivated by self-gain regardless of the consequences or 
the benefits to the organization for which he or she works. In such a 
case, the effort may be good for the individual and it may be good 
for the group, but the benefits, especially for the group, come with a 
time limit. Over time, this system will break down, often to the 
detriment of the organization. Developing trust to encourage people 
other than those with a predilection for risk, like Nick Leeson, is a 
better long-term strategy. 
Great organizations become great because the people inside the 
organization feel protected. The strong sense of culture creates a 
sense of belonging and acts like a net. People come to work know-
ing that their bosses, colleagues and the organization as a whole 
will look out for them. This results in reciprocal behavior. Indi-
vidual decisions, efforts and behaviors that support, benefit and 
protect the long-term interest of the organization as a whole.

Southwest Airlines, a company renowned for its customer focus, 
does not, as a matter of policy, believe the customer is always right. 
Southwest will not tolerate customers who abuse their staff. They 
would rather those customers fly on a different airline. It's a subtle 
irony that one of the best customer service companies in the country 
focuses on its employees before its customers. The trust between the 
management and the employees, not dogma, is what produces the 
great customer service. It is a prerequisite, then, for someone to 
trust the culture in which they work to share the values and beliefs 
of that culture. Without it, that employee, for example, is simply a 
bad fit and likely to work only for self-gain without consideration 
for the greater good. But if those inside the organization are a good 
fit, the opportunity to "go the extra mile," to explore, to invent, to 
innovate, to advance and, more importantly, to do so again and 
again and again, increases dramatically. Only with mutual trust can 
an organization become great. 
Real Trust Comes from the Things You Can't See 
"Rambo 2," said the voice over Brigadier General Jumper's radio, 
referring to him by his call sign. "Your group 180, twenty-five miles, 
closing fast." 
"Barnyard radar contact," replied Rambo 2, reporting that he had 
picked up the enemy group on his own radar. A one-star general, 
John Jumper was an experienced F-15 pilot with thousands of hours 
of flight time and over a thousand combat hours. By all measures, 
he was one of the best. Born in Paris, Texas, he had enjoyed a 
distinguished career. He'd flown just about everything the U.S. Air 
Force had, from cargo planes to fighter jets. Decorated and 
distinguished, the commander of his own combat wing, he was the 
embodiment of what it meant to be a fighter pilot. Smart and 
confident. 


--- Page 124 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
117 
But on that day, Jumper's reaction didn't match the situation he 
faced. By twenty-five miles, he would have been expected to fire his 
weapons or take some other offensive movement. Fearing that 
Jumper was locked onto the wrong contact on his radar, Captain 
Lori Robinson calmly repeated what she could see from miles away: 
"Rambo 2 confirm radar contact YOUR group now 190 twenty 
miles." 
As the air weapons controller who was watching the action on 
her radar screen from a nearby command-and-control center, it was 
Lori Robinson's job to direct the pilot toward enemy aircraft so that 
he could use his weapons to intercept and destroy them. Unlike an 
air traffic controller, whose job it is to keep air traffic apart, the 
weapons controller has to bring the planes closer together. From the 
vantage point of the radar screen, only the weapons controller has 
the big picture, as the pilot's onboard navigation system shows only 
what's directly in front of the aircraft. 
Captain Robinson saw her job as something bigger, however, 
than just staring at radar, something more profound than just being 
the eyes and ears for the pilots who were hurtling into harm's way 
at 1,500 mph. Captain Robinson knew WHY her job was important. 
She saw herself as responsible for clearing a path for the pilots in 
her care so that they could do what they needed to do, so they could 
push themselves and their aircraft further with greater confidence. 
And for this reason, she was unusually good at her job. Robinson 
couldn't make mistakes. If she did, she would lose the trust of her 
pilots and, worse, they would lose trust in themselves. You see, it's 
confidence that makes fighter pilots so good at their jobs. 
And then it happened. Captain Robinson could tell from the 
calm of Jumper's voice over the radio that he was unaware of the 
threat coming at him. On a cloudless day, 20,000 feet over the desert, 
the alarm screeched in Rambo 2's $25 million, state-of-the-art fighter 
jet. He looked up from his radar screen and saw the enemy

118 
engaging him. "BREAK RIGHT! BREAK RIGHT!" he screamed into 
his radio. On October 9, 1988, Brigadier General John R Jumper was 
killed. 
Captain Robinson waited. There was an eerie calm. Before too 
long, Jumper stormed into the debriefing room at Nellis Air Force 
Base. "You got me killed!" he barked at Captain Robinson. Situated 
in the Nevada desert, Nellis is home to the Air Force Fighter Weap-
ons School, and on that day, General John Jumper took a direct hit 
from a simulated missile from another U.S. Air Force jet playing the 
part of an enemy combatant. 
"Sir, it was not my fault," Captain Robinson replied calmly. 
"Check the video. You'll see." General Jumper, then the 57th Wing 
commander, a graduate of the USAF Fighter Weapons School, and a 
former instructor at Nellis, routinely evaluated every detail of every 
training mission he flew. Pilots often relied on the video to learn 
from their exercises. The video didn't lie. And it didn't on that day 
either. It revealed that the error was indeed his, not Captain 
Robinson's. It was a classic blunder. He had forgotten he was part of 
a team. He had forgotten that what made him so good at his job was 
not just his ability. Jumper was one of the best because there were 
others who were looking out for him. A massive infrastructure of 
people he couldn't see. 
Without question General Jumper had been given the best 
equipment, the best technology and the best training that money 
could buy. But it was the mechanics, the teachers, his fellow pilots, 
the culture of the Air Force and Captain Robinson who ensured that 
he could trust himself to get the job done. General Jumper forgot 
WHY he was so good and made a split-second decision that cost 
him his life. But this is what training is for, to learn these lessons. 
Some sixteen years after his lesson over the Nevada desert, 
General Jumper went on to big things. Now a retired four-star 
general, he served as chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force from 2001 to 


--- Page 126 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
119 
2005, the highest-ranking uniformed office in the entire Air Force, 
responsible for the organization, training and equipping of nearly 
700,000 active-duty, guard, reserve and civilian forces serving in the 
United States and overseas. As a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
he, along with the other service chiefs, advised the secretary of 
defense, the National Security Council and the president. 
This is not, however, a story about General Jumper. It is a story 
about Lori Robinson. Now herself a brigadier general in the Air 
Force, she no longer has her face down a scope. There are no more 
bogeys and bandits, the Air Force's nicknames for the good guys 
and the bad guys, in her life. Even though her job has changed, 
General Robinson still starts every day by reminding herself WHY 
she came to work. 
As much as she misses "her kids," as she called those who served 
under her command, General Robinson is still looking for ways she 
can clear a path for others so that they can push themselves and the 
organization further. "The time to think of yourself is done, it is not 
about you, it is about the lieutenants behind you," she'd remind her 
students when she was an instructor at the Fighter Weapons School. 
"If enough of us do this," she goes on, referring to WHY she does 
what she does, "then we leave this military and this country in better 
shape than we found it. And isn't that the point?" And it is that sense 
of purpose, a clear idea of WHY she comes to work, that has been 
the cornerstone of General Robinson's success. And that, 
incidentally, has been remarkable. 
Working hard to clear a path for others so that they can confi-
dently go on to do bigger and better things has in turn inspired 
others to clear a path for General Robinson to do exactly the same 
thing. As a woman in the very masculine world of the military, she 
sets an example for how to lead. Great leadership is not about flex-
ing and intimidation; great leaders, as General Robinson proves, 


--- Page 127 ---
START WITH WHY 
120 
lead with WHY. They embody a sense of purpose that inspires those 
around them. 
General Robinson was so trusted as a weapons controller that it 
was not unusual for pilots in training to request that she be assigned 
to them. "The greatest compliment I ever got was when people 
would say, 'When I go to war, I want Lori on the radio,'" she says. 
She is the first woman in the history of the Air Force to command 
the 552nd Air Control Wing out of Tinker Air Force Base, one of the 
largest wings in Air Combat Command (the wing that flies the 
AWACS airborne control aircraft—the fleet of Boeing 707s with the 
huge rotating radar dishes on top). She is the first commander of a 
combat wing ever who didn't come up through the pilot ranks. She 
was the first female Weapons School instructor to teach at the Air 
Force Fighter Weapons School, where the Air Force trains all its top 
guns. There, she became the most celebrated teacher in the ranks—
winning best teacher seven classes in a row. She is the first female 
director of the Secretary of the Air Force and Chief of Staff of the Air 
Force Executive Action Group. In 2000, the chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff said of General Robinson, at the time still a captain, 
that she singularly influenced his ideas on airpower. And the list 
goes on. 
By any measure, General Lori Robinson is a remarkable leader. 
Some in management positions operate as if they are in a tree of 
monkeys. They make sure that everyone at the top of the tree look-
ing down sees only smiles. But all too often, those at the bottom 
looking up see only asses. Great leaders like General Robinson are 
respected by those both above and below. Those in her command 
trust her implicitly because they know she's committed to looking 
after them. "There's nothing you can do that I can't fix," she was 
often heard telling students at Fighter Weapons School. And those 
to whom she reports show remarkable deference to her. "I don't 
know how she gets away with half the stuff she does," say those 


--- Page 128 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
121 
who know her. More importantly, it is said with a grin and with 
respect. General Robinson's ability to lead developed not because 
she's the smartest or the nicest. She's a great leader because she 
understands that earning the trust of an organization doesn't come 
from setting out to impress everyone, it comes from setting out to 
serve those who serve her. It is the invisible trust that gives a leader 
the following they need to get things done. And in Lori Robinson's 
case, things get done. 
I use the military because it exaggerates the point. Trust matters. 
Trust comes from being a part of a culture or organization with a 
common set of values and beliefs. Trust is maintained when the val-
ues and beliefs are actively managed. If companies do not actively 
work to keep their Golden Circle in balance—clarity, discipline and 
consistency—then trust starts to break down. A company, indeed 
any organization, must work actively to remind everyone WHY the 
company exists. WHY it was founded in the first place. What it 
believes. They need to hold everyone in the company accountable to 
the values and guiding principles. It's not enough to just write them 
on the wall—that's passive. Bonuses and incentives must revolve 
around them. The company must serve those whom they wish to 
serve it. 
With balance, those who are good fits can trust that everyone is 
on board for the same reasons. It's also the only way that each 
individual in the system can trust that others are acting to "leave the 
organization in a better way than we found it," to quote General 
Robinson again. This is the root of passion. Passion comes from 
feeling like you are a part of something that you believe in, some-
thing bigger than yourself. If people do not trust that a company is 
organized to advance the WHY, then the passion is diluted. Without 
managed trust, people will show up to do their jobs and they will 
worry primarily about themselves. This is the root of office 
politics—people acting within the system for self-gain often at the

expense of others, even the company. If a company doesn't manage 
trust, then those working for it will not trust the company, and self-
interest becomes the overwhelming motivation. This may be good 
for the short term, but over time the organization will get weaker 
and weaker. 
Herb Kelleher, the visionary behind Southwest Airlines, under-
stood this better than most. He recognized that to get the best out 
his employees he needed to create an environment in which they felt 
like the company cared about them. He knew that they would 
naturally excel if they felt the work they did made a difference. 
When a journalist asked Kelleher who comes first to him, his share-
holders or his employees, his response was heresy at the time (and 
to a large degree still is). "Well, that's easy," he said, "employees 
come first and if employees are treated right, they treat the outside 
world right, the outside world uses the company's product again, 
and that makes the shareholders happy. That really is the way that it 
works and it's not a conundrum at all." 
 
The influence of Others 
Whom do you trust more, someone you know or someone you 
don't know? What do you trust more, a claim made in a piece of 
advertising or a recommendation from a friend? Whom do you trust 
more, the waiter who tells you, "Everything on the menu is great," 
or the waiter who tells you to avoid the chicken casserole? Are these 
questions too easy? Then how about this one: why should anyone 
trust you? 
Personal recommendations go a long way. We trust the judg-
ment of others. It's part of the fabric of strong cultures. But we don't 
trust the judgment of just anyone. We are more likely to trust those 
who share our values and beliefs. When we believe someone has 
our best interest in mind because it is in their benefit to do so, the 
whole group benefits. The advancements of societies were based a 


--- Page 130 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
123 
great deal on the trust between those with a common set of values 
and beliefs. 
The feeling of trust is lodged squarely in the same place as the 
WHY—the limbic brain—and it's often powerful enough to trump 
empirical research, or at least seed doubt. This is the reason why so 
many manipulations are effective; we believe that, for better or 
worse, others know more than we do. Clearly, four out of five den-
tists know more than us when choosing chewing gum (but what 
about the one holdout . . . what did he know that the others didn't?). 
Of course we trust the celebrity endorsement. Those celebs are rich 
and can use any product they want. It must be good if they are 
putting their reputation on the line to promote it, right? 
You probably answered that question in your head already. 
Clearly they are endorsing the product because they are getting 
paid to. But if celebrity endorsements didn't work, companies 
wouldn't use them. Or perhaps it's the fear that they "might" work 
that fuels the million-dollar wink and a smile that encourages us to 
choose one car over another or one lipstick over another. The fact is, 
none of us is immune to the effect of someone we know or feel like 
we trust influencing our decisions. 
Celebrity endorsements are used with this concept in mind. By 
using a recognizable face or name, so the assumption goes, people 
will more likely trust the claims being made. The flaw in this 
assumption is that celebrity status alone may work to influence 
behavior, but at this level it's just peer pressure. For it to work, the 
celebrity needs to represent some clear cause or belief. An athlete 
known for her work ethic may have some value to a company with 
the same belief, for example. Or an actor known for his charitable 
work would be good fit for a company known for doing good. In 
these cases, it is clear that both the company and the celebrity are 
working together to advance the same cause. I recently saw an ad 
for TD Ameritrade that featured morning show hosts Regis Philbin 


--- Page 131 ---
START WITH WHY 
124 
and Kelly Ripa. I'm still trying to figure out the cause that two talk 
show hosts represent and how that matters when it comes to 
choosing one bank over another. When a company says that a 
celebrity represents "the kind of qualities we want our customers to 
associate with us," they miss the point. The celebrity is another 
WHAT to the company's WHY. The celebrity must embody the 
qualities that already exist at the company. Without clarity of WHY 
first, any benefit will amount to simply increasing recognition. 
So many decisions (and indeed contract negotiations) are based 
on an advertising industry measurement called a Q-score—a 
quotient of how well recognized a celebrity is, how famous they are, 
so to speak. The higher the score, the better the unaided awareness 
of the celebrity. This information alone is not enough. The clearer 
the spokesperson's own WHY is understood, the better ambassador 
they can be for a like-minded brand or company. But there is no 
measurement of a celebrity's WHY currently available, so the result 
is obvious. The value of too many celebrity endorsements is the 
celebrity appeal alone. Unless the audience to which you are trying 
to appeal gets a sense of what that spokesperson believes, unless 
that spokesperson is "one of us," the enforcement may drive recog-
nition, it may even drive sales for the short term, but it will fail to 
build trust. 
A trusted recommendation is powerful enough to trump facts 
and figures and even multimillion-dollar marketing budgets. Think 
of the young father who wants to do everything right for his new-
born child. He decides he's going to get a new car—something safe, 
something to protect his child. He spends a week reading all the 
magazines and reports, he's seen all the advertising and decides that 
on Saturday he's buying a Volvo. The facts are in and his mind is 
made up. Friday night he and his wife head to a dinner party. 
Standing by the punch bowl is their friend the local car enthusiast. 
Our intrepid new father walks up to his friend and proudly 


--- Page 132 ---
THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST 
125 
announces that, as a new father, he's decided to buy a Volvo. With-
out a thought his friend replies, "Why would you do that? Mercedes 
is the safest car on the road. If you care about your kid, you'll get a 
Mercedes." 
Playing on his desires to be a good father, but also trusting his 
friend's opinion, one of three things will happen. Our young father 
will either change his mind and buy a Mercedes; he will go forward 
with his original decision, but not without some doubt about 
whether he's indeed doing the right thing; or he will go back to the 
drawing board to redo all his research in order to reassure himself 
of his decision. No matter how much rational information he has at 
his fingertips, unless that decision also feels right, stress will go up 
and confidence will go down. However you slice it, the opinions of 
others matter. And the opinions of those we trust matter most. 
The question isn't how should car companies talk to the father 
who bought the car. The question isn't even how they court the 
highly influential opinion of his friend, the car guy. The concept of 
buyer and influencers isn't a new one. The question is, how do you 
get enough of the influencers to talk about you so that you can make 
the system tip?

HOW A TIPPING POINT TIPS 
If I told you I knew of a company that invented an amazing new 
technology that will change the way we consume TV, would that 
pique your interest? Perhaps you'd be interested in buying their 
product or investing in their company. It gets better. They have the 
single best product available. Their quality is through the roof, way 
better than anything else on the market. And their PR efforts have so 
been remarkable, they've even become a household name. 
Interested? 
This is the case of TiVo. A company that seemed to have every-
thing going for them but turned out to be a commercial and finan-
cial failure. Since they seemed to have the recipe for success, TiVo's 
flop defied conventional wisdom. Their struggles, however, are eas-
ily understood if you consider that they thought WHAT they did

mattered more than WHY. They also ignored the Law of Diffusion 
of Innovations. 
In 2000, Malcolm Gladwell created his own tipping point when 
he shared with us how tipping points happen in business and in so-
ciety. In his aptly named book The Tipping Point, Gladwell identifies 
groups of necessary populations he calls connectors and influencers. 
With little doubt Gladwell's ideas are spot-on. But it still begs the 
question, why should an influencer tell anyone about you? 
Marketers are always trying to influence the influencers, but few 
really know how. We can't dispute that tipping points happen and 
the conditions that Gladwell articulates are right, but can a tipping 
point happen intentionally? They can't just be an accidental 
phenomenon. If they exist, then we should be able to design one, 
and if we can design one, we should be able to design one that lasts 
beyond the initial tip. It's the difference between a fad and an idea 
that changes an industry or society forever. 
In his 1962 book Diffusion of Innovations, Everett M. Rogers was 
the first to formally describe how innovations spread through so-
ciety. Thirty years later, in his book Crossing the Chasm, Geoffrey 
Moore expanded on Rogers's ideas to apply the principle to high-
tech product marketing. But the Law of Diffusion of Innovations 
explains much more than just the spread of innovation or technol-
ogy. It explains the spread of ideas. 
If you don't know the law, you're likely already familiar with 
some of its terminology. Our population is broken into five seg-
ments that fall across a bell curve: innovators, early adoptors, early 
majority, late majority and laggards. 


--- Page 136 ---
HOW A TIPPING POINT TIPS 
129 
 
As the law states, the first 2.5 percent of the population are the 
innovators, and the next 13.5 percent are early adopters. Innovators, 
Moore says, pursue new products or ideas aggressively and are 
intrigued by any fundamental advance; being first is a central part 
of their lives. As their name suggests, innovators are the small per-
centage of the population that challenges the rest of us to see and ! 
think of the world a little differently. 
Early adopters are similar to innovators in that they appreciate 
the advantages wrought by new ideas or technologies. They are 
early to recognize the value of new ideas and are quite willing to 
put up with imperfection because they can see the potential. Al-
though quick to see the potential and willing to take risks to try new 
technologies or ideas, early adopters are not idea generators like the 
innovators. But both groups are similar, as Moore says, in that they 
rely heavily on their intuition. They trust their gut. 
Early adopters, like innovators but to a lesser degree, are willing 
to pay a premium or suffer some level of inconvenience to own a 
product or espouse an idea that feels right. Those on the left side of 
the diffusion curve are the ones who stood in line for six hours to be 
among the first to buy the iPhone, Apple's entry into the mobile 
phone market, even though they could have walked into a store a 
week later and bought one without waiting. Their willingness to 
suffer an inconvenience or pay a premium had less to do with how 


--- Page 137 ---
START WITH WHY 
130 
great the product was and more to do with their own sense of who 
they are. They wanted to be the first. 
These are also the personality types who bought flat-screen TVs 
when they first came out even though they cost upwards of $40,000 
and the technology was still far from perfect. My friend Nathan fits 
this profile. I walked around his house once and counted no fewer 
than twelve Bluetooth earpieces for his mobile phone lying around 
his house. I asked him why he had so many. "Did they all break?" I 
queried. "No," he replied, "they came out with a new one." (There 
were also about five laptops, various models of BlackBerry smart 
phones and boxes of other gadgets lying about that never quite 
worked that well.) Nathan is an early adopter. 
The next 34 percent of the population are the early majority, fol-
lowed by the late majority, and finally the laggards on the far right 
side of the spectrum. Laggards are the ones who buy touchtone 
phones only because they don't make rotary phones anymore. The 
early and late majority are more practical-minded. For them, 
rational factors matter more. The early majority is slightly more 
comfortable with new ideas or technologies, while the late majority 
is not. 
The farther right you go on the curve, the more you will en-
counter the clients and customers who may need what you have, 
but don't necessarily believe what you believe. As clients, they are 
the ones for whom, no matter how hard you work, it's never 
enough. Everything usually boils down to price with them. They are 
rarely loyal. They rarely give referrals and sometimes you may even 
wonder out loud why you still do business with them. "They just 
don't get it," our gut tells us. The importance of identifying this 
group is so that you can avoid doing business with them. Why 
invest good money and energy to go after people who, at the end of 
the day, will do business with you anyway if you meet their 
practical requirements but will never be loyal if you don't? It's not 


--- Page 138 ---
HOW A TIPPING POINT TIPS 
131 
too hard to recognize where people fall on the spectrum once you're 
in a relationship with them; the opportunity is to figure out which is 
which before you decide to work with them. 
We all sit at different places on this spectrum depending on the 
product or idea. Most of us are fiercely loyal to certain products and 
ideas at various times and demonstrate left-side-of-the-curve 
behavior. And for other products or ideas we exhibit right-side-of- 
the-curve behavior. When we sit on one side of the spectrum, we 
often have a hard time understanding those on the other side be-
cause their behavior doesn't make sense to us. My sister is an early 
adopter when it comes to fashion trends, whereas I'm firmly in the 
late majority. It was only recently that I finally caved and bought a 
pair of overpriced designer blue jeans. I admit they look good, but I 
still think they aren't worth the money and I can't understand why 
my sister thinks they are. 
In contrast, I'm an early adopter for some technologies. I bought 
a Blue-ray DVD player before they had perfected the technology. I 
paid about four or five times more for it compared to a regular DVD 
player. My sister can't understand why I waste my money on all 
that "useless stuff," as she puts it. We will never see eye to eye on 
this stuff. 
Each of us assigns different values to different things and our 
behaviors follow accordingly. This is one of the major reasons why 
it is nearly impossible to "convince" someone of the value of your 
products or ideas based on rational arguments and tangible bene-
fits. It's the old Ferrari and Honda Odyssey debate again. Designer 
jean companies (or my sister) can talk to me until they are blue in 
the face about the importance of fabric quality, design and 
workmanship—it goes in one ear and out the other. Similarly, it can 
be proven, beyond a shadow of doubt, the rational benefits of 
choosing a $500 DVD player over a $100 one; my sister won't hear a 
word of it. And so the game of manipulation ensues. Again, al-


--- Page 139 ---
START WITH WHY 
132 
though always effective, manipulations don't breed loyalty and they 
increase costs and stress for all parties involved. 
Most people or organizations that have something to sell, be it a 
product, service or idea, hope to achieve some level of mass- market 
success or acceptance. Most hope to penetrate the bell of the curve. 
Getting there, however, is easier said than done. When you ask 
small businesses about their goals, many of them will tell you they 
want to be a billion-dollar business in X number of years. The odds 
of that happening, unfortunately, don't look good. Of the 27 million 
businesses registered in the United States, fewer than 2,000 ever 
reach a billion dollars in annual revenues. And 99.9 percent of all 
businesses in America have fewer than 500 employees. In other 
words, mass-market success is really hard to achieve. 
Big companies have similar challenges repeating their mass- 
market success. Just because they've done it once or twice doesn't 
mean they know how to do it every time. The Zune, Microsoft's 
entry into the multigigabyte mp3 player market, for example, was 
pegged to "take on the iPod." It didn't happen. Even if the quality is 
superior, there is more to succeeding than just the product and the 
marketing. Don't forget, the superior Betamax technology did not 
beat out the substandard VHS technology as the standard format for 
videotape in the 1980s. The best does not always win. Like any 
natural law, the Law of Diffusion must be considered if mass- 
market acceptance is important to you. Refusal to do so will cost a 
lot of money and may result in a mediocre success, if not complete 
failure. 
There is an irony to mass-market success, as it turns out. It's near 
impossible to achieve if you point your marketing and resources to 
the middle of the bell, if you attempt to woo those who represent 
the middle of the curve without first appealing to the early adopters. 
It can be done, but at massive expense. This is because the early 
majority, according to Rogers, will not try something until someone 


--- Page 140 ---
HOW A TIPPING POINT TIPS 
133 
else has tried it first. The early majority, indeed the entire majority, 
need the recommendation of someone else who has already 
sampled the product or service. They need to know someone else has 
tested it. They need that trusted, personal recommendation. 
According to the Law of Diffusion, mass-market success can only 
be achieved after you penetrate between 15 percent to 18 percent of 
the market. That's because the early majority won't try something 
new until someone else has tried it first. This is why we have to 
drop our price or offer value-added services. We're attempting to 
reduce the risk tolerance of these practical-minded people until they 
feel comfortable to buy. That's what a manipulation is. They may 
buy, but they won't be loyal. Don't forget, loyalty is when people are 
willing to suffer some inconvenience or pay a premium to do 
business with you. They may even turn down a better offer from 
someone else—something the late majority rarely does. The ability 
to get the system to tip is the point at which the growth of a business 
or the spreading of an idea starts to move at an extraordinary pace. 
It is also at this point that a product gains mass-market acceptance. 
The point at which an idea becomes a movement. When that 
happens, the growth is not only exponential, it is automatic. It just 
goes. 
The goal of business then should not be to simply sell to anyone 
who wants what you have—the majority—but rather to find people 
who believe what you believe, the left side of the bell curve. They 
perceive greater value in what you do and will happily pay a 
premium or suffer some sort of inconvenience to be a part of your 
cause. They are the ones who, on their own volition, will tell others 
about you. That 15 to 18 percent is not made up of people who are 
simply willing to buy the product. It is the percentage of people 
who share your beliefs and want to incorporate your ideas, your 
products and your services into their own lives as WHATs to their 
own WHYs. They look to WHAT you do as a tangible element that 


--- Page 141 ---
START WITH WHY 
134 
demonstrates their own purpose, cause or belief to the outside 
world. Their willingness to pay a premium or suffer inconvenience 
to use your product or service says more about them than it does 
about you and your products. Their ability to easily see WHY they 
need to incorporate your products into their lives makes this group 
the most loyal customers. They are also the most loyal shareholders 
and the most loyal employees. No matter where they sit in the spec-
trum, these are the people who not only love you but talk about 
you. Get enough of the people on the left side of the curve on your 
side and they encourage the rest to follow. 
I love asking businesses what their conversion is on new busi-
ness efforts. Many answer proudly, "Ten percent." Even if you ig-
nore the principles of The Golden Circle, the law of averages says 
you can win about 10 percent of the business. Throw enough spa-
ghetti against the wall and some of it sticks. To grow the business, 
all you need to do is more prospecting, which is why growing your 
business by aiming at the middle of the curve is so expensive. 
Though the business may grow, the average will stay about the 
same, and 10 percent is not enough for the system to tip. 
Likewise, 10 percent of your existing customers or clients will 
naturally show loyalty to you. But why are they so loyal? Like our 
inability to explain why we love our spouses, the best we can mus-
ter up to explain what makes them such great clients is, "They just 
get it." And though this explanation may feel right, it is completely 
unactionable. How do you get more people to "get it"? This is what 
Moore refers to as the "chasm," the transition between the early 
adopters and the early majority, and it's hard to cross. But not if you 
know WHY. 
If you have the discipline to focus on the early adopters, the majority 
will come along eventually. But it must start with WHY. Simply 
focusing on so-called influencers is not enough. The challenge is, 
which influencers? There are those who seem to fit the influencer 


--- Page 142 ---
HOW A TIPPING POINT TIPS 
135 
profile more than others, but in reality we are all influencers at 
different times for different reasons. You don't just want any 
influencer, you want someone who believes what you believe. Only 
then will they talk about you without any prompts or incentives. If 
they truly believe in what you believe and if they are truly on the 
left side of the curve they won't need to be incentivized; they'll do it 
because they want to. The entire act of incentivizing an influencer is 
manipulative. It renders the influencer completely inauthentic to his 
or her group. It won't take long for the group to find out that a 
recommendation wasn't made with the group's best interest in 
mind, but rather because of one person's self-interest. Trust erodes 
and the value of the influencer is rendered useless. 
Refusing to Consider the Law of Diffusion Will Cost You 
In 1997, TiVo was racing to market with a remarkable new device. 
Few would debate that from the time the product was introduced to 
the present day, TiVo has had the single highest-quality product in 
its category. The company's PR has been extraordinary. They have 
achieved an unaided awareness that most brands can only dream of. 
They have become more than generic terms, like Kleenex, Band-Aids 
and Q-tips. In fact, they have been able to achieve more than generic 
status; they are a verb in the English language, "to TiVo." 
They were well funded with venture capital and had a tech-
nology that could truly reinvent how we consume television. The 
problem was, they marketed their technology directly to the middle 
of the bell curve. Seeing the mass-market appeal of the product, they 
ignored the principles of the Law of Diffusion and targeted the 
masses. Compounding that bad aim, they attempted to appeal to the 
cynical majority by explaining WHAT the product did instead of 
stating WHY the company or the product existed in the first place. 
They attempted to convince with features and benefits. 
They basically said to the mass market: 


--- Page 143 ---
START WITH WHY 
136 
We've got a new product. 
It pauses live TV. 
Skips commercials. 
Rewinds live TV. 
Memorizes your viewing habits and records shows on your 
behalf without your needing to set it. 
Analysts were intrigued by the prospects of TiVo as well as its 
competitor, Replay, a well-funded start-up backed by venture cap-
ital. One market researcher estimated that these so-called personal 
TV receivers would reach 760,000 subscribers by the end of the first 
year. 
TiVo finally shipped in 1999. Mike Ramsay and Jim Barton, two 
former colleagues who had founded TiVo, were certain the TV- 
viewing public was ready. And they may have been if only TiVo 
knew how to talk to them. But despite the excitement among ana-
lysts and technophiles, sales were hugely disappointing. TiVo sold 
about 48,000 units the first year. Meanwhile, Replay, whose backers 
included the founders of Netscape, failed to gain a following and 
instead became embroiled in a dispute with the television networks 
over the way it allowed viewers to skip ads. In 2000, the company 
adopted a new strategy and a few months later was sold to 
SonicBlue, which later filed for bankruptcy. 
Analysts were stumped as to why the TiVo machines weren't 
selling better. The company seemed to have everything going for it. 
After all, they had the recipe for success: a great-quality product, 
money and ideal market conditions. In 2002, after TiVo had been on 
the market nearly three years, a headline in Advertising Age summed 
it up best: "More U.S. Homes Have Outhouses than TiVos." (At the 
time, there were 671,000 homes with outhouses in the United States, 
compared with 504,000 to 514,000 homes with TiVo.) Not only were 
sales poor, but the company has not fared well for its shareholders 
either. At the time of the initial public offering in the fall of 1999, 


--- Page 144 ---
HOW A TIPPING POINT TIPS 
137 
TiVo stock traded at slightly over $40 per share. A few months later 
it hit its high at just over $50. The stock declined steadily for the rest 
of the year, and except for three short periods since 2001, it has 
never since traded over $10. 
If you apply the principles of The Golden Circle, the answer is 
clear—people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it, 
and TiVo attempted to convince consumers to buy by telling them 
only WHAT the product did. Features and rational benefits. The 
practical-minded, technophobic mass market's response was 
predictable. "I don't understand it. I don't need it. I don't like it. 
You're scaring me." There were a small number of TiVo loyalists, 
probably about 10 percent, those who just "got it," who didn't need 
an explicit articulation of WHY. They exist to this day, but there 
were not enough of them to create the tipping point that TiVo 
needed and predicted. 
What TiVo should have done is talked about what they believed. 
They should have talked about WHY the product was invented in 
the first place, and then ventured out to share their invention with 
the innovators and early adopters who believed what they believed. 
If they had started their sales pitch with WHY the product existed in 
the first place, the product itself would have become the proof of the 
higher cause—proof of WHY. If their Golden Circle was in balance, 
the outcome might have been quite different. Compare the original 
list of features and benefits with a revised version that starts with 
WHY: 
If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control of every 
aspect of your life, boy do we have a product for you. 
It pauses live TV. 
Skips commercials. 
Rewinds live TV. 


--- Page 145 ---
START WITH WHY 
138 
Memorizes your viewing habits and records shows on your behalf 
without you needing to set it. 
 
In this version, all the features and rational benefits serve as 
tangible proof of WHY the product exists in the first place, not the 
reasons to buy, per se. The WHY is the belief that drives the 
decision, and WHAT it does provides us a way to rationalize the 
appeal of the product. 
Confirming their failure to tap the right segment of the market, 
TiVo offered a very rational explanation of what was happening. 
"Until people get their hands on it," Rebecca Baer, a spokeswoman 
for TiVo, told the New York Times in 2000, "they don't understand 
why they need this." If this line of logic was true, then no new 
technology would ever take hold. A fact that is patently untrue. 
Though Ms. Baer was correct about the mass market's failure to 
understand the value, it was TiVo's failure to properly communicate 
and rally the left side of the bell curve to educate and encourage the 
adoption that was the reason so few people "got their hands on it." 
TiVo did not start with WHY. They ignored the left side of the curve 
and completely failed to find the tipping point. And for those 
reasons, "people didn't get their hands on it," and the mass market 
didn't buy it. 
Fast-forward almost a decade. TiVo continues to have the best 
digital video-recording product on the market. Its unaided aware-
ness continues to be through the roof. Nearly everyone knows now 
what the product is and what it does, yet the company's future is by 
no means secure. 
While millions of viewers may say they "TiVo" things all the 
time, unfortunately for TiVo, they aren't using a TiVo system. 
Rather, they "TiVo" shows using a digital video recorder provided 
by the cable or satellite company. Many try to make the argument 
that TiVo's failure was due to the cable companies' superior

distribution. But we know that people often go out of their way, pay 
a premium or suffer an inconvenience to buy a product that 
resonates on a visceral level with them. Until recently, people who 
wanted a custom Harley-Davidson motorcycle waited upwards of 
six months to a year to take delivery of their product. By any 
standard, that's just bad service. Consumers could have just walked 
into a Kawasaki dealership and walked right out with a brand-new 
bike. They could have found a very similar model with similar 
power and maybe even for less money. But they suffered the 
inconvenience willingly, not because they were in the market for a 
motorcycle, but because they wanted a Harley. 
TiVo is not the first to ignore these sound principles and won't be 
the last. The meager success of satellite radio technology like Sirius 
or XM Radio has followed a similar path. They offered a well-
publicized, well-funded new technology that attempted to convince 
users with a promise of rational features and benefits—no 
commercials and more channels than the competition. Throw in an 
impressive array of celebrity endorsements, including rap star 
Snoop Dog and 1970s pop icon David Bowie, and the technology 
still didn't stick. When you start with WHY, those who believe what 
you believe are drawn to you for very personal reasons. It is those 
who share your values and beliefs, not the quality of your products, 
that will cause the system to tip. Your role in the process is to be 
crystal clear about what purpose, cause or belief you exist to cham-
pion, and to show how your products and services help advance 
that cause. Absent a WHY, new ideas and technologies quickly find 
themselves playing the price-and-feature game—a sure sign of an 
absence of WHY and a slide into commodity status. It is not the 
technology that failed, it was how the companies tried to sell it.

combined company sold for less than 50 cents apiece. And, last time 
I checked, XM was offering a discount, a promotion, free shipping 
and a claim of being "America's #1 satellite radio service with over 
170 channels" to push their product. 
Give the People Something to Believe In 
On August 28, 1963, 250,000 people from across the country de-
scended on the Mall in Washington, D.C., to hear Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. give his famous "I Have a Dream" speech. The organizers 
didn't send out 250,000 invitations and there was no Web site to 
check the date. How did they get a quarter of a million people to 
show up on the right day at the right time? 
During the early 1960s, the country was torn apart by racial 
tensions. There were riots in dozens of cities in 1963 alone. America 
was a country scarred by inequality and segregation. How the civil 
rights movement lifted an idea that all men are created equal to 
become a movement with the power to change a country is 
grounded in the principles of The Golden Circle and the Law of 
Diffusion. 
Dr. King was not the only person alive during that time who 
knew WHAT had to change to bring about civil rights in America. 
He had many ideas about WHAT needed to happen, but so did 
others. And not all of his ideas were good. He was not a perfect 
man; he had his complexities. 
But Dr. King was absolute in his conviction. He knew change had 
to happen in America. His clarity of WHY, his sense of purpose, 
gave him the strength and energy to continue his fight against often 
seemingly insurmountable odds. There were others like him who 
shared his vision of America, but many of them gave up after too 
many defeats. Defeat is painful. And the ability to continue head-on, 
day after day, takes something more than knowing what legislation 
needs to be passed. For civil rights to truly take hold in the country,

its organizers had to rally everyone. They may have been able to 
pass legislation, but they needed more than that, they needed to 
change a country. Only if they could rally a nation to join the cause, 
not because they had to, but because they wanted to, could any 
significant change endure. But no one person can effect lasting 
change alone. It would take others who believed what King 
believed. 
The details of HOW to achieve civil rights or WHAT needed to 
be done were debatable, and different groups tried different strate-
gies. Violence was employed by some, appeasement by others. Re-
gardless of HOW or WHAT was being done, there was one thing 
everyone had in common—WHY they were doing it. It was not just 
Martin Luther King's unflappable conviction that was able to stir a 
population, but his ability to put his WHY into words. Dr. King had 
a gift. He talked about what he believed. And his words had the 
power to inspire: 
"I believe." 
"I believe." 
"I believe." 
"There are two types of laws," he shared, "those that are just and 
those that are unjust. A just law," Dr. King expounded, "is a man- 
made code that squares with the moral law. An unjust law is a code 
that is out of harmony with the moral law.... Any law that uplifts the 
human personality is just. Any law that degrades human per-
sonality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segre-
gation distorts the soul and damages the personality." His belief was 
bigger than the civil rights movement. It was about all of mankind 
and how we treat each other. Of course, his WHY developed as a 
result of the time and place in which he was born and the color of 
his skin, but the civil rights movement served as the ideal platform 
for Dr. King to bring his WHY, his belief in equality, to life.

142 
People heard his beliefs and his words touched them deep in-
side. Those who believed what he believed took that cause and 
made it their own. And they told people what they believed. And 
those people told others what they believed. Some organized to get 
that belief out more efficiently. 
And in the summer of 1963, a quarter of a million people showed 
up to hear Dr. King deliver his "I Have a Dream" speech on the steps 
of the Lincoln Memorial. 
But how many people showed up for Dr. King? 
Zero. 
They showed up for themselves. It was what they believed. It was 
what they saw as an opportunity to help America become a better 
version of itself. It was they who wanted to live in a country that 
reflected their own values and beliefs that inspired them to get on a 
bus to travel for eight hours to stand in the Washington sun in the 
middle of August to hear Dr. King speak. Being in Washington was 
simply one of the things they did to prove what they believed. 
Showing up that day was one of the WHATs to their own WHY. 
This was a cause and it was their cause. 
Dr. King's speech itself served as a visceral reminder of the belief 
shared by everyone who stood there listening. And that speech was 
about what he believed, not how they were going to do it. He gave 
the "I Have a Dream" speech, not the "I Have a Plan" speech. It was 
a statement of purpose and not a comprehensive twelve- point plan 
to achieving civil rights in America. Dr. King offered America a 
place to go, not a plan to follow. The plan had its place, but not on 
the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. 
Dr. King's articulation of his belief was something powerful 
enough to rally those who shared that belief even if they weren't 
personally affected by the inequalities. Nearly a quarter of the peo-
ple who came to the rally that day were white. This was a belief not 
about black America, this was a belief about a shared America. Dr.

King was the leader of a cause. A cause for all those who believed 
what he believed regardless of skin color. 
It wasn't the details of his plans that earned him the right to lead. 
It was what he believed and his ability to communicate it clearly 
that people followed. In essence, he, like all great leaders, became 
the symbol of the belief. Dr. King came to personify the cause. To 
this day we build statues of him to keep that belief alive and 
tangible. People followed him not because of his idea of a changed 
America. People followed him because of their idea of a changed 
America. The part of the brain that influences our behavior and 
decisions does not have the capacity for language. We have trouble 
saying clearly, in emotional terms, why we do what we do, and 
offer rationalizations that, though valid and true, are not powerful 
enough to inspire others. So when asked why they showed up that 
day, people pointed to Dr. King and said simply, "Because I 
believe." 
More than anything else, what Martin Luther King Jr. gave us 
was clarity, a way to explain how we felt. He gave us the words that 
inspired us. He gave us something to believe in, something we 
could easily share with our friends. Everyone at the Mall that day 
shared a set of values and beliefs. And everyone there that day, re-
gardless of skin color or race or sex, trusted each other. It was that 
trust, that common bond, that shared belief that fueled a movement 
that would change a nation. 
We believed.

START WITH WHY, BUT KNOW HOW 
Energy Excites. Charisma Inspires. 
RAH!!!! With a roar, Steve Ballmer, the man who replaced Bill Gates 
as CEO of Microsoft, bursts onto the stage of the company's annual 
global summit meeting. Ballmer loves Microsoft—he says so in no 
uncertain words. He also knows how to pump up a crowd. His 
energy is almost folkloric. He pumps his fists and runs from one end 
of the stage to the other, he screams and he sweats. He is remarkable 
to watch and the crowd loves it. As Ballmer proves, without a 
doubt, energy can motivate a crowd. But can it inspire a population? 
What happens the next day or the next week when Ballmer's energy 
is not there to motivate his employees? Is energy enough to keep a 
company of about 80,000 people focused? 


--- Page 155 ---
START WITH WHY 
148 
In contrast, Bill Gates is shy and awkward, a social misfit. He 
does not fit the stereotype of the leader of a multibillion-dollar 
corporation. He is not the most energetic public speaker. When Bill 
Gates speaks, however, people listen with bated breath. They hang 
on his every word. When Gates speaks, he doesn't rally a room, he 
inspires it. Those who hear him take what he says and carry his 
words with them for weeks, months or years. Gates doesn't have 
energy, but Bill Gates inspires. 
Energy motivates but charisma inspires. Energy is easy to see, 
easy to measure and easy to copy Charisma is hard to define, nearly 
impossible to measure and too elusive to copy. All great leaders 
have charisma because all great leaders have clarity of WHY; and an 
undying belief in a purpose or cause bigger than themselves. It's not 
Bill Gates's passion for computers that inspires us, it's his undying 
optimism that even the most complicated problems can being 
solved. He believes we can find ways to remove obstacles to ensure 
that everyone can live and work to their greatest potential. It is his5 
optimism to which we are drawn. 
Living through the computer revolution, he saw the computer as 
a perfect technology to help us all become more productive and 
achieve our greatest potential. That belief inspired his vision of a, PC 
on every desk to come to life. Ironic considering Microsoft never 
even made PCs. It wasn't just WHAT computers did that; Gates saw 
the impact for the new technology, it was WHY we needed them. 
Today, the work he does with the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation has nothing to do with software, but it is another way he 
has found to bring his WHY to life. He is looking for ways to solve 
problems. He still has an undying belief. And he still: believes that if 
we can help people, this time those with less privilege, remove some 
seemingly simple obstacles, then they too will have an opportunity 
to be more productive and lift themselves up to achieve their great

potential. For Gates, all that has changed is WHAT he is doing to 
bring his cause to life. 
Charisma has nothing to do with energy; it comes from a clarity 
of WHY. It comes from absolute conviction in an ideal bigger than 
oneself. Energy, in contrast, comes from a good night's sleep or lots 
of caffeine. Energy can excite. But only charisma can inspire. 
Charisma commands loyalty. Energy does not. 
Energy can always be injected into an organization to motivate 
people to do things. Bonuses, promotions, other carrots and even a 
few sticks can get people to work harder, for sure, but the gains are, 
like all manipulations, short-term. Over time, such tactics cost more 
money and increase stress for employee and employer alike, and 
eventually will become the main reason people show up for work 
every day. That's not loyalty. That's the employee version of repeat 
business. Loyalty among employees is when they turn down more 
money or benefits to continue working at the same company. 
Loyalty to a company trumps pay and benefits. And unless you're 
an astronaut, it's not the work we do that inspires us either. It's the 
cause we come to work for. We don't want to come to work to build 
a wall, we want to come to work to build a cathedral. 
The Chosen Path 
Raised in Ohio, sixty miles from Dayton, Neil Armstrong grew up 
on a healthy diet of stories about the Wright brothers. From a very 
early age he dreamed of flying. He'd make model airplanes, read 
magazines about flying and stare at the heavens through a telescope 
mounted on the roof of his house. He even got his pilot's license 
before he got his driver's license. With a childhood passion that 
became reality, Armstrong was destined to become an astronaut. 
For the rest of us, however, our careers paths are more like Jeff 
Sumpter's. 


--- Page 157 ---
START WITH WHY 
150 
While Sumpter was in high school, his mother arranged for him 
to get a summer internship at the bank where she worked. Four 
years after he finished high school he called the bank to see if he 
could do some part-time work, and they eventually offered him a 
full-time job. Whamo, Jeff's got a career as a banker. In fact, after 
fifteen years in the industry he and a colleague by the name of Trey 
Maust went on to start their own bank, Lewis & Clark Bank in 
Portland, Oregon. 
Sumpter is very good at what he does—he's been one of the top-
performing loan officers throughout his career. He's well liked and 
well respected among his colleagues and clients. But even Jeff will 
admit that he doesn't have much of a passion for banking, per se. 
Though he's not living out his childhood dream, he is passionate for 
something. It's not WHAT he does that gets him out of bed every 
morning. It's WHY he does it. 
Our career paths are largely incidental. I never planned to be 
doing what I'm doing now. As a kid I wanted to be an aeronautical 
engineer, but in college I set my sights on becoming a criminal pros-
ecutor. While I was in law school, however, I became disillusioned 
with the idea of being a lawyer. It just didn't feel right. I was at law 
school in England, where the law is one of the last truly "English" 
professions; not wearing a pinstriped suit to an interview could hurt 
my chances of getting a job. This was not my cup of tea. 
I happened to be dating a young woman who was studying 
marketing at Syracuse University. She could see what inspired me 
and what frustrated me about the law and suggested I try my hand 
in the field. And whamo, I'd gotten myself a new career in market-
ing. But that's just one of the things I've done—it's not my passion 
and it's not how I define my life. My cause—to inspire people to do 
the things that inspire them—is WHY I get out of bed every day. The 
excitement is trying to find new ways, different WHATs to bring my 
cause to life, of which this book is one. 


--- Page 158 ---
STATUS BUT WHY, BUT KNOW HOW 
151 
Regardless of WHAT we do in our lives, our WHY—our driving 
purpose, cause or belief—never changes. If our Golden Circle is in 
balance, WHAT we do is simply the tangible way we find to breathe 
life into that cause. Developing software was merely one of the 
things Bill Gates did to bring his cause to life. An airline gave Herb 
Kelleher the perfect outlet to spread his belief in freedom. Putting a 
man on the moon was one goal John F. Kennedy used to rally people 
to bring to life his belief that service to the nation—and not being 
serviced by the nation—would lead America to advance and 
prosper. Apple gave Steve Jobs a way to challenge the status quo 
and do something big in the world. All the things these charismatic 
leaders did were the tangible ways they found to bring their WHYs 
to life. But none of them could have imagined WHAT they would be 
doing when they were young. 
When a WHY is clear, those who share that belief will be drawn to it 
and maybe want to take part in bringing it to life. If that belief is 
amplified it can have the power to rally even more believers to raise 
their hands and declare, "I want to help." With a group of believers 
all rallying around a common purpose, cause or belief, amazing 
things can happen. But it takes more than inspiration to do become 
great. Inspiration only starts the process; you need something more 
to drive a movement. 
Amplify the Source of Inspiration 
The Golden Circle is not just a communication tool; it also 
provides some insight into how great organizations are organized. 
As we start to add dimension to the concept of The Golden Circle, it 
is no longer helpful to look at it as a purely two-dimensional model. 
If it is to provide any real value in how to build a great organization 
in our very three-dimensional world, The Golden Circle needs to be 
three-dimensional. The good news is, it is. It is, in fact, a top-down 
view of a cone. Turn it on its side and you can see its full value. 


--- Page 159 ---
START WITH WHY 
152 
 
The cone represents a company or an organization—an 
inherently hierarchical and organized system. Sitting at the top of 
the system, representing the WHY, is a leader; in the case of a 
company, that's usually the CEO (or at least we hope it is). The next 
level down, the HOW level, typically includes the senior executives 
who are inspired by the leader's vision and know HOW to bring it 
to life. Don't forget that a WHY is just a belief, HOWs are the actions 
we take to realize that belief and WHATs are the results of those ac-
tions. No matter how charismatic or inspiring the leader is, if there 
are not people in the organization inspired to bring that vision to 
reality, to build an infrastructure with systems and processes, then 
at best, inefficiency reigns, and at worst, failure results. 
In this rendering the HOW level represents a person or a small 
group responsible for building the infrastructure that can make a 
WHY tangible. That may happen in marketing, operations, finance, 
human resources and all the other C-suite departments. Beneath 
that, at the WHAT level, is where the rubber meets the road. It is at 
this level that the majority of the employees sit and where all the 
tangible stuff actually happens. 
I Have a Dream (and He's Got the Plan) 
Dr. King said he had a dream, and he inspired people to make 
his dream their own. What Ralph Abernathy lent the movement 


--- Page 160 ---

was something else: he knew what it would take to realize that 
dream, and he showed people HOW to do it. He gave the dream 
structure. Dr. King spoke about the philosophical implications of 
the movement, while Abernathy, Dr. King's onetime mentor, long-
time friend and financial secretary and treasurer of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference, would help people understand 
the specific steps they needed to take. "Now," Abernathy would tell 
the audience following a rousing address by Dr. King, "let me tell 
you what that means for tomorrow morning." 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was the leader, but he didn't change 
America alone. Though Dr. King inspired the movement, to actually 
move people requires organizing. As is the case with almost all 
great leaders, there were others around Dr. King who knew better 
HOW to do that. For every great leader, for every WHY-type, there 
is an inspired HOW-type or group of HOW-types who take the 
intangible cause and build the infrastructure that can give it life. 
That infrastructure is what actually makes any measurable change 
or success possible. 
The leader sits at the top of the cone—at the start, the point of 
WHY—while the HOW-types sit below and are responsible for ac-
tually making things happen. The leader imagines the destination 
and the HOW-types find the route to get there. A destination 
without a route leads to meandering and inefficiency, something a 
great many WHY-types will experience without the help of others to 
ground them. A route without a destination, however, may be 
efficient, but to what end? It's all fine and good to know how to 
drive, but it's more fulfilling when you have a place to go. For Dr. 
King, Ralph Abernathy was one of those he inspired and who knew 
HOW to make the cause actionable and tangible. "Dr. King's job was 
to interpret the ideology and theology of non-violence," said 
Abernathy. "My job was more simple and down-to-earth. I would 
tell [people], 'Don't ride those buses."' 


--- Page 161 ---
START WITH WHY 
154 
In every case of a great charismatic leader who ever achieved 
anything of significance, there was always a person or small group 
lurking in the shadows who knew HOW to take the vision and 
make it a reality. Dr. King had a dream. But no matter how inspiring 
a dream may be, a dream that cannot come to life stays a dream. Dr. 
King dreamed of many of the same things as countless other African 
Americans who grew up in the pre-civil rights South. He spoke of 
many of the same themes. He felt the same outrage perpetrated by 
an unjust system. But it was King's unflappable optimism and his 
words that inspired a population. 
Dr. King didn't change America by himself. He wasn't a legisla-
tor, for example, but legislation was created to give all people in the 
United States equal rights regardless of skin color. It wasn't Dr. King 
who changed America; it was the movement of millions of others 
whom he inspired that changed the course of history. But how do 
you organize millions of people? Forget millions, how do you 
organize hundreds or tens of people? The vision and charisma of the 
leader are enough to attract the innovators and the early adopters. 
Trusting their guts and their intuition, these people will make the 
greatest sacrifices to help see the vision become a reality. With each 
success, with every tangible demonstration that the vision can in 
fact become reality, the more practical-minded majority starts to 
take interest. What was previously just a dream soon becomes a 
provable and tangible reality. And when that happens, a tipping 
point can be reached and then things really get moving. 
Those Who Know WHY Need Those Who Know HOW 
The pessimists are usually right, to paraphrase Thomas Friedman, 
author of The World Is Flat, but it's the optimists who change the 
world. Bill Gates imagined a world in which the computer could 
help us all reach our greatest potential. And it happened. Now he 
imagines a world in which malaria does not exist. And it will hap-

pen. The Wright brothers imagined a world in which we'd all take 
to the skies as easily as we catch the bus. And it happened. WHY- 
types have the power to change the course of industries or even the 
world ... if only they knew HOW. 
WHY-types are the visionaries, the ones with the overactive 
imaginations. They tend to be optimists who believe that all the 
things they imagine can actually be accomplished. HOW-types live 
more in the here and now. They are the realists and have a clearer 
sense of all things practical. WHY-types are focused on the things 
most people can't see, like the future. HOW-types are focused on 
things most people can see and tend to be better at building 
structures and processes and getting things done. One is not better 
than the other, they are just different ways people naturally see and 
experience the world. Gates is a WHY-type. So were the Wright 
brothers. And Steve Jobs. And Herb Kelleher. But they didn't do it 
alone. They couldn't. They needed those who knew HOW. 
"If it hadn't been for my big brother, I'd have been in jail several 
times for checks bouncing," said Walt Disney, only half joking, to a 
Los Angeles audience in 1957. "I never knew what was in the bank. 
He kept me on the straight and narrow." Walt Disney was a WHY- 
type, a dreamer whose dream came true thanks to the help of his 
more sensible older brother Roy, a HOW-type. 
Walt Disney began his career creating cartoon drawings for ad-
vertisements, but moved quickly to making animated movies. It was 
1923 and Hollywood was emerging as the heart of the movie 
business, and Walt wanted to be part of it. Roy, who was eight years 
older, had been working at a bank. Roy was always in awe of his 
brother's talent and imagination, but he also knew that Walt was 
prone to taking risks and to neglecting business affairs. Like all 
WHY guys, Walt was busy thinking about what the future looked 
like and often forget he was living in the present. "Walt Disney 
dreamed, drew and imagined, Roy stayed in the shadow, forming 


--- Page 163 ---
START WITH WHY 
156 
an empire," wrote Bob Thomas, a Disney biographer. "A brilliant 
financier and businessman, Roy helped turn Walt Disney's dreams 
into reality, building the company that bears his brother's name." It 
was Roy who founded the Buena Vista Distribution Company that 
made Disney films a central part of American childhood. It was Roy 
who created the merchandising business that transformed Disney 
characters into household names. And, like almost every HOW-
type, Roy never wanted to be the front man, he preferred to stay in 
the background and focus on HOW to build his brother's vision. 
Most people in the world are HOW-types. Most people are quite 
functional in the real world and can do their jobs and do very well. 
Some may be very successful and even make millions of dollars, but 
they will never build billion-dollar businesses or change the world. 
HOW-types don't need WHY-types to do well. But WHY-guys, for 
all their vision and imagination, often get the short end of the stick. 
Without someone inspired by their vision and the knowledge to 
make it a reality, most WHY-types end up as starving visionaries, 
people with all the answers but never accomplishing much 
themselves. 
Although so many of them fancy themselves visionaries, in real-
ity most successful entrepreneurs are HOW-types. Ask an entre-
preneur what they love about being an entrepreneur and most will 
tell you they love to build things. That they talk about building is a 
sure clue that they know HOW to get things done. A business is a 
structure—systems and processes that need to be assembled. It is the 
HOW-types who are more adept at building those processes and 
systems. But most companies, no matter how well built, do not 
become billion-dollar businesses or change the course of industries. 
To reach the billion-dollar status, to alter the course of an industry, 
requires a very special and rare partnership between one who 
knows WHY and those who know HOW. 


--- Page 164 ---
STATUS BUT WHY, BUT KNOW HOW 
157 
In nearly every case of a person or an organization that has gone 
on to inspire people and do great things, there exists this special 
partnership between WHY and HOW. Bill Gates, for example, may 
have been the visionary who imagined a world with a PC on every 
desk, but Paul Allen built the company. Herb Kelleher was able to 
personify and preach the cause of freedom, but it was Rollin King 
who came up with the idea for Southwest Airlines. Steve Jobs is the 
rebel's evangelist, but Steve Wozniak is the engineer who made the 
Apple work. Jobs had the vision, Woz had the goods. It is the 
partnership of a vision of the future and the talent to get it done that 
makes an organization great. 
This relationship starts to clarify the difference between a vision 
statement and a mission statement in an organization. The vision is 
the public statement of the founder's intent, WHY the company 
exists. It is literally the vision of a future that does not yet exist. The 
mission statement is a description of the route, the guiding 
principles—HOW the company intends to create that future. When 
both of those things are stated clearly, the WHY-type and the HOW-
type are both certain about their roles in the partnership. Both are 
working together with clarity of purpose and a plan to get there. For 
it to work, however, it requires more than a set of skills, it requires 
trust. 
As discussed at length in part 3, trusting relationships are in-
valuable for us to feel safe. Our ability to trust people or organiza-
tions allows us to take risks and feel supported in our efforts. And 
perhaps the most trusting relationship that exists is between the 
visionary and the builder, the WHY-guy and the HOW-guy. In or-
ganizations able to inspire, the best chief executives are WHY- 
types—people who wake up every day to lead a cause and not just 
run a company. In these organizations, the best chief financial of-
ficers and chief operating officers are high-performing HOW-types, 
those with the strength of ego to admit they are not visionaries

158 
themselves but are inspired by the leader's vision and know how to 
build the structure that can bring it to life. The best HOW-types 
generally do not want to be out front preaching the vision; they 
prefer to work behind the scenes to build the systems that can make 
the vision a reality. It takes the combined skill and effort of both for 
great things to happen. 
It's not an accident that these unions of WHY and HOW so often 
come from families or old friendships. A shared upbringing and life 
experience increases the probability of a shared set of values and 
beliefs. In the case of family or childhood friends, upbringing and 
common experiences are nearly exactly the same. That's not to say 
you can't find a good partner somewhere else. It's just that growing 
up with somebody and having a common life experience increases 
the likelihood of a shared common worldview. 
Walt Disney and Roy Disney were brothers. Bill Gates and Paul 
Allen went to high school together in Seattle. Herb Kelleher was 
Rollin King's divorce attorney and old friend. Martin Luther King Jr. 
and Ralph Abernathy both preached in Birmingham, long before 
the civil rights movement took form. And Steve Jobs and Steve 
Wozniak were best friends in high school. The list goes on. 
To Run or To Lead 
For all the talented HOW-types running today's organizations, they 
can achieve success that will last their lifetimes, but they will spend 
their lifetimes running their companies. There are many ways to be 
successful and drive profits. Any number of manipulations, only 
some of which I've touched upon in this book, work quite well. 
Even the ability to create a tipping point is possible without creating 
lasting change. It's called a fad. But great organizations function 
exactly like any social movement. They inspire people to talk about 
a product or idea, include that product in the context of their 
lifestyle, share the idea or even find ways to advance the prosperity

of the organization itself. Great organizations not only excite the 
human spirit, they inspire people to take part in helping to advance 
the cause without needing to pay them or incentivize them in any 
particular way. No cash-back incentives or mail-in rebates required. 
People feel compelled to spread the word, not because they have to, 
but because they want to. They willingly take up arms to share the 
message that inspires them. 
Build a Megaphone That Works 
After a three-month selection process, BCI finally chose a new ad 
agency to help develop a campaign to launch their new product 
line. Big Company Incorporated is a well-known brand operating in 
a fairly cluttered market space. As a manufacturer, their products 
are sold via a third-party sales force, often on the shelves of big-box 
retailers, so they don't have direct control over the sales process. The 
best they can do is to try to influence the sale from a distance— with 
marketing. BCI is a good company with a strong culture. The 
employees respect the management, and in general the company 
does good work. But over the years the competition has grown 
fairly stiff. And although BCI has a good product and competitive 
pricing, it is still tough to maintain strong growth year over year. 
This year, BCI management is particularly excited because the 
company is launching a new product they really think will make 
BCI stand out. To help promote it, BCI's agency has launched a 
major new ad campaign. 
"From the leading maker," says the new ad, "comes the newest, 
most innovative product you've ever seen." The ad goes on to talk 
about all the new features and benefits, and includes something 
about the "quality you've come to expect from BCI," something the 
BCI executives felt quite strongly about including. BCI executives 
have worked hard to build their company's reputation and they 
want to leverage it. They are very excited about their new campaign

and are really banking on the success of this product to help drive 
sales in general. They know they do good work, and they want to 
get the message out. They need it to be loud. And with a budget of 
millions of dollars to advertise their new product, in that respect, 
BCI succeeds. 
But there is a problem. 
BCI and their agency did a good job of telling people about their 
new product. The work was quite creative. They were able to 
explain what was new and special about their latest innovation, and 
focus groups agreed that the new product was much better than 
that of the competition. The millions of dollars in media ensured 
that lots of people would see their advertising and see it often. Their 
reach and frequency, the measurement commonly used by ad 
agencies to gauge the number of people exposed to the advertising, 
was very good. There is no doubt that their message was loud. The 
problem was, it wasn't clear. It was all WHATs and HOW and no 
WHY. Even though people learned what the product did, no one 
knew what BCI believed. The good news is, it's not a complete loss; 
the products will sell as long as the ads are on the air and the 
promotions remain competitive. It's an effective strategy, but an 
expensive way to make money. 
What if Martin Luther King had delivered a comprehensive 
twelve-point plan about achieving civil rights in America, a plan 
more comprehensive than any other plan for civil rights ever of-
fered? Booming through the speakers that summer's day in 1963, his 
message would have been loud. Microphones, like advertising and 
PR, are fantastic for making sure a message is heard. Like BCI, 
King's message would still have reached thousands of people. But 
his belief would not have been clear. 
Volume is reasonably easy to achieve. All it takes is money or 
stunts. Money can pay to keep a message front and center. And 
publicity stunts are good at getting on the news. But neither plants 


--- Page 168 ---

seeds of loyalty. Many reading this may remember that Oprah Win-
frey once gave away a free car to every member of her studio audi-
ence. It happened several years ago, in 2004, and still people refer to 
the stunt. But how many can recall the model of car she gave away? 
That's the problem. It was Pontiac that donated $7 million worth of 
cars, 276 of their new G6 model, to be exact. And it was Pontiac that 
saw the stunt as a way to market their new car. Yet although the 
stunt worked well to reinforce Oprah's generous nature, something 
with which we are all familiar, few remember that Pontiac was a 
part of the event. Worse, the stunt didn't do anything to reinforce 
some purpose, cause or belief that Pontiac represents. We had no 
idea what Pontiac's WHY was before the stunt, so it’s hard for the 
publicity stunt to do much more than, well, be a stunt to get some 
publicity. With no sense of WHY, there is nothing else it's doing. 
For a message to have real impact, to affect behavior and seed 
loyalty, it needs more than publicity. It needs to publicize some 
higher purpose, cause or belief to which those with similar values 
and beliefs can relate. Only then can the message create any lasting 
mass-market success. For a stunt to appeal to the left side of the 
curve of the Law of Diffusion, WHY the stunt is being performed, 
beyond the desire to generate press, must be clear. Though there 
may be short-term benefits without clarity, loud is nothing more 
than excessive volume. Or in business vernacular: clutter. And 
companies wonder why differentiation is such a challenge these 
days. Have you heard the volume coming from some of them?1 
In contrast, what would have been the impact of Dr. King’s 
speech had he not had a microphone and loudspeakers? His vision 
would have been no less clear. His words would have been no less 
inspiring. He knew what he believed and he spoke with passion and 
charisma about that belief. But only the few people with front-row 
seats would have been inspired by those words. A leader with a 
cause, whether it be an individual or an organization, must have a 


--- Page 169 ---
START WITH WHY 
162 
megaphone through which to deliver his message. And it must be 
clear and loud to work. Clarity of purpose, cause or belief is 
important, but it is equally important that people hear you. For a 
WHY to have the power to move people it must not only be clear, it 
must be amplified to reach enough people to tip the scale. 
It's no coincidence that the three-dimensional Golden Circle is a 
cone. It is, in practice, a megaphone. An organization effectively 
becomes the vessel through which a person with a clear purpose, 
cause or belief can speak to the outside world. But for a megaphone 
to work, clarity must come first. Without a clear message, what will 
you amplify? 
Say It Only If You Believe It 
Dr. King used his megaphone to rally throngs of people to follow 
him in pursuit of social justice. The Wright brothers used their 
megaphone to rally their local community to help them build the 
technology that could change the world. Thousands of people heard 
John F. Kennedy's belief in service and rallied to put a man on the 
moon in less than a decade. The ability to excite and inspire people 
to go out of their way to contribute to something bigger than 
themselves is not unique to social causes. Any organization is 
capable of building a megaphone that can achieve a huge impact. In 
fact, it is one of the defining factors that makes an organization 
great. Great organizations don't just drive profits, they lead people, 
and they change the course of industries and sometimes our lives in 
the process. 
A clear sense of WHY sets expectations. When we don't know an 
organization's WHY, we don't know what to expect, so we expect 
the minimum—price, quality, service, features—the commodity 
stuff. But when we do have a sense for the WHY, we expect more. 
For those not comfortable being held to a higher standard, I strongly 
advise against trying to learn your WHY or keeping your Golden

163 
Circle in balance. Higher standards are hard to maintain. It requires 
the discipline to constantly talk about and remind everyone WHY 
the organization exists in the first place. It requires that everyone in 
the organization be held accountable to HOW you do things—to 
your values and guiding principles. And it takes time and effort to 
ensure that everything you say and do is consistent with your 
WHY. But for those willing to put in the effort, there are some great 
advantages. 
Richard Branson first built Virgin Records into a multibillion- 
dollar retail music brand. Then he started a successful record label. 
Later he started an airline that is today considered one of the pre-
mier airlines in the world. He then started a soda brand, wedding- 
planning company, insurance company and mobile phone service. 
And the list goes on. Likewise, Apple sells us computers, mobile 
phones, DVRs and mp3 players, and has replicated their capacity 
for innovation again and again. The ability of some companies not 
to just succeed but to repeat their success is due to the loyal 
followings they command, the throngs of people who root for their 
success. In the business world, they say Apple is a lifestyle brand. 
They underestimate Apple's power. Gucci is a lifestyle brand—
Apple changes the course of industries. By any definition these few 
companies don't function like corporate entities. They exist as social 
movements. 
Repeating Greatness 
Ron Bruder is not a household name, but he is a great leader. In 
1985, he stood at a crosswalk with his two daughters waiting for the 
light to change so they could cross the street. A perfect opportunity, 
he thought, to teach the young girls a valuable life lesson. He 
pointed across the street to the red glow of the "Do Not Walk" signal 
and asked them what they thought that sign meant. "It means we 


--- Page 171 ---
START WITH WHY 
164 
have to stand here," they replied. "Are you sure?" he asked 
rhetorically. "How do you know it's not telling us to run?" 
Soft-spoken and almost always wearing a well-tailored three- piece 
suit when he comes to work, Bruder looks like you would imagine a 
conservative executive to look like. But don't assume you know how 
things work simply based on what you see. Bruder is anything but a 
stereotype. Though he has enjoyed the trappings of success, he is not 
motivated by them. They have always been the unintended by-
product of his work. Bruder is driven by a clear sense of WHY. He 
sees a world in which people accept the lives they live and do the 
things they do not because they have to, but because no one ever 
showed them an alternative. This is the lesson he was teaching his 
daughters that day at the crosswalk—there is always another 
perspective to be considered. That Bruder always starts with WHY 
has enabled him to achieve great things for himself. But more 
significantly, it is his ability to share his WHY through the things he 
does that inspires those around him to do great things for 
themselves. 
Like most of us, the career path Bruder has followed is incidental. 
But WHY he does things has never changed. Everything Bruder has 
ever done starts with his WHY, his unyielding belief that if you can 
simply show someone that an alternative route is possible, it can 
open the possibility that such a route can be followed. Though the 
work he is doing today is world-altering, Bruder hasn't always been 
in the world peace business. Like many inspiring leaders, he has 
changed the course of an industry. But Ron Bruder is no one-hit 
wonder. He has been able to repeat his success and change the 
course of multiple industries, multiple times. 
A senior executive at a large food conglomerate that sold vege-
tables, canned goods and meats decided to buy a travel agency for 
his nephew. He asked Bruder, as the chief financial officer of the 
company at the time, to take a look at the financials of the agency 


--- Page 172 ---
STATUS BUT WHY, BUT KNOW HOW 
165 
before he went through with the purchase. Seeing an opportunity 
others didn't, Bruder decided to join the small travel agency to help 
lead it. Once there, he saw how all the other travel agencies worked 
and took an alternative course. Greenwell became the first travel 
agency on the eastern seaboard to take advantage of new technolo-
gies and fully computerize their operations. Not only did they be-
come one of the most successful companies in the region, but after 
only a year, their business model became a standard for the whole 
industry. Then Bruder did it again. 
A former client of Bruder's, Sam Rosengarten, was in some dirty 
businesses—coal, oil and gas; all industries that created brown- 
fields, land that had been contaminated by their operations. Little 
could be done with brownfields. They were too polluted to develop, 
and the liability to clean them up was so high that the insurance 
premiums alone made it too prohibitive to even try. But Bruder 
doesn't see challenges the same way as everyone else. Most avoided 
brownfields because they could only see the cost to clean them up. 
Bruder focused instead on the actual cleaning. His alternative 
perspective revealed the perfect solution. 
Bruder had already formed his real estate development 
company, Brookhill, and with eighteen employees, he was doing 
quite well. Knowing what he needed to do to seize the opportunity, 
he approached Dames & Moore, one of the largest environmental 
engineering companies in the world, and shared his new 
perspective with them. They loved his idea and formed a 
partnership to pursue it. With an engineering company with 18,000 
people on board, the perceived risk was greatly minimized and the 
insurance companies were happy to offer affordable insurance. With 
affordable insurance in place, Credit Suisse First Boston offered 
financing that gave Brookhill the ability to buy, remediate, 
redevelop and sell almost $200 million worth of former 
environmentally contaminated properties. Brookhill, so called

166 
because Bruder comes from Brooklyn and, as he puts it, "it's a long, 
uphill climb to get out of Brooklyn," was the pioneer of the 
brownfield redevelopment industry. An industry that thrives to this 
day. Bruder's WHY not only steered a path that was good for 
business, but in the process also helped clean up the environment. 
It doesn't matter WHAT Ron Bruder does. The industries and the 
challenges are incidental. What never changes is WHY he does 
things. Bruder knows that, no matter how good an opportunity 
looks on paper, no matter how smart he is and no matter his track 
record, he would never be able to achieve anything unless there 
were others to help him. He knows that success is a team sport He 
has a remarkable ability to attract those who believe what he 
believes. Talented people are drawn to him with one request: "How 
can I help?" Having defied accepted perspectives and revolutionized 
more than one industry, Bruder has now set his sights on a bigger 
challenge: world peace. He founded the Education for Employment 
Foundation, the megaphone that would help him do it. 
The EFE Foundation is making significant headway in helping 
young men and women in the Middle East to significantly alter the 
course of their lives and indeed the course of the region. Just has he 
taught his daughters at the crosswalk that there is always an alter-
native route, he brings an alternative perspective to the problems in 
Middle East. Like of all Bruder's past successes, the EFE Foundation 
will drive businesses and do tremendous amounts of good in the 
process. Bruder doesn't run companies, he leads movements. 
All Movements Are Personal 
It started on September 11,2001. Like so many of us, Bruder turned 
his attention to the Middle East after the attacks to ask why some-
thing like that could happen. He understood that if such an event 
could happen once, it could happen again, and for the lives of his 
own daughters he wanted to find a way to prevent that.

167 
In the course of trying to figure out what he could do, he made a 
remarkable discovery that went much deeper than protecting his 
daughters or even the prevention of terrorism in the United States. 
In America, he realized, the vast majority of young people wake up 
in the morning with a feeling that there is opportunity for them in 
the future. Regardless of the economy, most young boys and girls 
who grow up in the United States have an inherent sense of opti-
mism that they can achieve something if they want to—to live the 
American Dream. A young boy growing up in Gaza or a young girl 
living in Yemen does not wake up every day with the same feeling. 
Even if they have the desire, the same optimism is not there. It is too 
easy to point and say that the culture is different. That is not 
actionable. The real reason is that there is a distinct lack of institu-
tions to give young people in the region a sense of optimism for 
their future. A college education in Jordan, for example, may offer 
some social status, but it doesn't necessarily prepare a young adult 
for what lies ahead. The education system, in cases like this, per-
petuates a systemic cultural pessimism. 
Bruder realized the problems we face with terrorism in the West 
have less to do with what young boys and girls in the Middle East 
think about America and more to do with what they think about 
themselves and their own vision of the future. Through the EFE 
Foundation, Bruder is setting up programs across the Middle East to 
teach young adults the hard and soft skills that will help them feel 
like they have opportunity in life. To feel like they can be in control 
of their own destinies. Bruder is using the EFE Foundation to share 
his WHY on a global scale—to teach people that there is always an 
alternative to the path they think they are on. 
The Education for Employment Foundation is not an American 
charity hoping to do good in faraway lands. It is a global movement. 
Each EFE operation runs independently, with locals making up the 
majority of their local boards. Local leaders take personal responsi-

168 
bility to give young men and women that feeling of opportunity by 
giving them the skills, knowledge and, most importantly, the 
confidence to choose an alternative path for themselves. Mayyada 
Abu-Jaber is leading the movement in Jordan. Mohammad Naja is 
spreading the cause in Gaza and the West Bank. And Maeen Alery- 
ani is proving that a cause can even change a culture in Yemen. 
In Yemen, children can expect to receive nine years of education; 
This is one of the lowest rates in the world. In the United States, 
children can expect sixteen years. Inspired by Bruder, Aleryani sees 
such an amazing opportunity for young men and women to change 
their perspective and take greater control of their own future. He set 
out to find capital to jump-start his EFE operation in Sana'a, 
Yemen's capital, and in one week was able to raise $50,000. The 
speed at which he raised that amount is pretty good even by our 
philanthropic standards. But this is Yemen, and Yemen has no 
culture of philanthropy, making his achievement that much more 
remarkable. Yemen is also one of the poorest nations in the region. 
But when you tell people WHY you're doing what you're doing, 
remarkable things happen. 
Across the region, everyone involved in EFE believes that they 
can help teach their brothers and sisters and sons and daughters the 
skills that will help them change path that they think they are on. 
They are working to help the youth across the region believe that 
their future is bright and full of opportunity. And they don't do it for 
Bruder, they do it for themselves. That's the reason EFE will change 
the world. 
Sitting at the top of the megaphone, at the point of WHY, 
Bruder's role is to inspire, to start the movement. But it is those who 
believe who will effect the real change and keep the movement 
going. Anyone, regardless where they live, what they do or their 
nationality, can participate in this movement. It's about feeling like 
we belong. If you believe that there is an alternative path to the one

They marched in, single file. Not a word was spoken. No one made 
any eye contact with anyone else. They all looked the same. Their 
heads shaved, their clothes gray and tattered. Their boots dusty. One 
by one, they filled a large, cavernous room, like a hangar from a sci-
ence fiction movie. The only color was gray. The walls were gray 
Dust and smoke filled the space making even the air look gray. 
Hundreds, maybe even thousands of these drone-people sat on 
neatly organized benches. Row after row after row. A sea of gray 
conformity. They all watched a projection of a huge talking head on 
the screen in the front of the room that filled the entire wall. This 
apparent leader recited dogma and propaganda, stating proudly 
that they were in complete control. They had achieved perfection, 
They were free of pests. Or so they thought.

Running down one of the tunnels that led into the cavernous 
hangar, a lone blonde woman. She wore bright red shorts and a 
crisp white T-shirt. Like a lighthouse, her complexion and the color 
of hei clothes seemed to shine through gray air. Pursued by security, 
she rail with a sledgehammer. This would not end well for the status 
quo. 
On January 22, 1984, Apple launched their Macintosh computer 
with their now-famous commercial depicting an Orwellian scene of 
a totalitarian regime holding control over a population and 
promised that "1984 won't be like 1984" But this advertising was 
much more than just advertising. It was not about the features and 
benefits of a new product. It was not about a "differentiating value 
proposition." It was, for all intents and purposes, a manifesto. A 
poetic ode to Apple's WHY, it was the film version of an individual 
rebelling against the status quo, igniting a revolution. And though 
their products have changed and fashions have changed, this 
commercial is as relevant today as it was twenty-five years ago 
when it first aired. And that's because a WHY never changes. 
WHAT you do can change with the times, but WHY you do it never 
does. 
The commercial is one of the many things the company has done 
or said over the years to show or tell the outside world what they 
believe. All Apple's advertising and communications, their 
products, partnerships, their packaging, their store design, they are 
all WHATs to Apple's WHY, proof that they actively challenge sta-
tus quo thinking to empower the individual. Ever notice that their 
advertising never shows groups enjoying their products? Always 
individuals. Their Think Different campaign depicted individuals 
who thought differently, never groups. Always individuals. And 
when Apple tells us to "Think Different," they are not just describing 
themselves. The ads showed pictures of Pablo Picasso, Martha 
Graham, Jim Henson, Alfred Hitchcock, to name a few, with the line 


--- Page 180 ---
KNOW WHY, KNOW HOW, THEN WHAT? 
173 
"Think Different" on the upper right hand side of the page. Apple 
does not embody the rebel spirit because they associated themselves 
with known rebels. They chose known rebels because they embody 
the same rebel spirit. The WHY came before the creative solution in 
the advertising. Not a single ad showed a group. This is no accident. 
Empowering the individual spirit is WHY Apple exists. Apple 
knows their WHY and so do we. Agree with them or not, we know 
what they believe because they tell us. 
Speak Clearly and Ye Shall Be Clearly Understood 
An organization is represented by the cone in the three-dimensional 
view of The Golden Circle. This organized system sits atop another 
system: the marketplace. The marketplace is made up of all the cus-
tomers and potential customers, all the press, the shareholders, all 
the competition, suppliers and all the money. This system is 


--- Page 181 ---
START WITH WHY 
174 
inherently chaotic and disorganized. The only contact that the 
organized system has with the disorganized system is at the base—
at the WHAT level. Everything an organization says and does 
communicates the leader's vision to the outside world. All the 
products and services that the company sells, all the marketing and 
advertising, all the contact with the world outside communicate 
this. If people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it, 
and if all the things happening at the WHAT level do not clearly 
represent WHY the company exists, then the ability to inspire is 
severely complicated. 
When a company is small, this is not an issue because the 
founder has plenty of direct contact with the outside world. Trusted 
HOW-types may be in short supply and the founder opts to make a 
majority of the big decisions. The founder or leader actually goes 
out and talks to customers, sells the product and hires most if not all 
the employees. As the company grows, however, systems and 
processes are added and other people will join. The cause embodied 
by an individual slowly morphs into a structured organization and 
the cone starts to take shape. As it grows, the leader's role changes. 
He will no longer be the loudest part of the megaphone; he will 
become the source of the message that is to flow through the 
megaphone. 
When a company is small, it revolves around the personality of 
the founder. There is no debate that the founder's personality is the 
personality of the company. Why then do we think things change 
just because a company is successful? What's the difference between 
Steve Jobs the man and Apple the company? Nothing. What's the 
difference between Sir Richard Branson's personality and Virgin's 
personality? Nothing. As a company grows, the CEO's job is to per-
sonify the WHY. To ooze of it. To talk about it. To preach it. To be a 
symbol of what the company believes. They are the intention and 
WHAT the company says and does is their voice. Like Martin Lu-


--- Page 182 ---
KNOW WHY, KNOW HOW, THEN WHAT? 
175 
ther King and his social movement, the leader's job is no longer to 
close all the deals; it is to inspire. 
As the organization grows, the leader becomes physically re-
moved, farther and farther away from WHAT the company does, 
and even farther away from the outside market. I love asking CEOs 
what their biggest priority is, and, depending on their size or struc-
ture, I generally get one of two answers: customers or shareholders. 
Sadly, there aren't many CEOs of companies of any reasonable size 
who have daily contact with customers anymore. And customers 
and shareholders alike both exist outside the organization in the 
chaotic world of the marketplace. Just as the cone demonstrates, the 
CEO's job, the leader's responsibility, is not to focus on the outside 
market—it's to focus on the layer directly beneath: HOW. The leader 
must ensure that there are people on the team who believe what 
they believe and know HOW to build it. The HOW- types are 
responsible for understanding WHY and must come to work every 
day to develop the systems and hire the people who are ultimately 
responsible for bringing the WHY to life. The general employees are 
responsible for demonstrating the WHY to the outside world in 
whatever the company says and does. The challenge is that they are 
able to do it clearly. 
Remember the biology of The Golden Circle. The WHY exists in 
the part of the brain that controls feelings and decision-making but 
not language. WHATs exist in the part of the brain that controls 
rational thought and language. Comparing the biology of the brain 
to the three-dimensional rendering of The Golden Circle reveals a 
profound insight. 


--- Page 183 ---
START WITH WHY 
176 
 
The leader sitting at the top of the organization is the inspiration, 
the symbol of the reason we do what we do. They represent the 
emotional limbic brain. WHAT the company says and does 
represents the rational thought and language of the neocortex. Just 
as it is hard for people to speak their feelings, like someone trying to 
explain why they love their spouse, it is equally hard for an 
organization to explain its WHY. The part of the brain that controls 
feelings and the part that controls language are not the same. Given 
that the cone is simply a three-dimensional rendering of The Golden 
Circle, which is firmly grounded in the biology of human decision-
making, the logic follows that organizations of any size will struggle 
to clearly communicate their WHY. Translated into business terms 
this means that trying to communicate your differentiating value 
proposition is really hard. 
Put bluntly, the struggle that so many companies have to dif-
ferentiate or communicate their true value to the outside world is 
not a business problem, it's a biology problem. And just like a per-

son struggling to put her emotions into words, we rely on meta-
phors, imagery and analogies in an attempt to communicate how we 
feel. Absent the proper language to share our deep emotions, our 
purpose, cause or belief, we tell stories. We use symbols. We create 
tangible things for those who believe what we believe to point to 
and say, "That's why I'm inspired." If done properly, that's what 
marketing, branding and products and services become; a way for 
organizations to communicate to the outside world. Communicate 
clearly and you shall be understood.

Martin Luther King Jr., a man who would become a symbol of the 
entire civil rights movement, chose to deliver his famous "I Have 0 
Dream" speech in front of another symbol: the Lincoln Memorial, 
Like King, Lincoln stands (or in the case of the memorial, sits) as a 
symbol of the American value of freedom for all. Great societies 
understand the importance of symbols as a way of reinforcing their 
values, of capturing their beliefs. Dictators understand the impor-
tance of symbols all too well. But in their case, the symbols are 
usually of them and not of a larger belief. Symbols help us make tan-
gible that which is intangible. And the only reason symbols have 
meaning is because we infuse them with meaning. That meaning 
lives in our minds, not in the item itself. Only when the purpose, 
cause or belief is clear can a symbol command great power. 
The flag, for example, is nothing more than a symbol of out 
nation's values and beliefs. And we follow the flag into battle. That's 
some serious power. Ever notice the patch of the American flag on a 
soldier's right arm? It's backward. There was no mistake made, it's 
like that on purpose. A flag flying on a staff, as an army was rushing 
into battle, would appear backward if viewed from the right side, To

put it the other way around on the right shoulder would appeal as if 
the soldier were in retreat. 
Our flag is infused with so much meaning that some have tried 
to pass laws banning its desecration. It's not the material out of 
which the flag is sewn that these patriots aim to protect. The laws 
they propose have nothing to do with the destruction of property. 
Their goal is to protect the meaning the symbol represents: the 
WHY. The laws they drafted tried to protect the intangible set of 
values and beliefs by protecting the symbol of those values and 
beliefs. Though the laws have been struck down by the Supreme 
Court, they have spurred contentious and emotionally charged de-
bates. They pit our desire for freedom of expression with our desire 
to protect a symbol of that freedom. 
Ronald Reagan, the Great Communicator, knew all too well the 
power of symbols. In 1982, he was the first president to invite a 
"hero" to sit in the balcony of the House chamber during the State of 
the Union address, a tradition that has continued every year since. 
A man who exuded optimism, Reagan knew the value of 
symbolizing the values of America instead of just talking about 
them. His guest, who sat with the First Lady, was Lenny Skutnik, a 
government employee who had dived into the icy Potomac just 
days before to save a woman who had fallen from a helicopter that 
was attempting to rescue her after an Air Florida plane crashed into 
the river. Reagan was trying to make a point, that words are hollow, 
but deeds and values are deep. After he told Skutnik's story he 
waxed, "Don't let anyone tell you that America's best days are be-
hind her, that the American spirit has been vanquished. We've seen 
it triumph too often in our lives to stop believing in it now." Skutnik 
became Reagan's symbol of courage. 
Most companies have logos, but few have been able to convert 
those logos into meaningful symbols. Because most companies are 
bad at communicating what they believe, so it follows that most 


--- Page 188 ---
COMMUNICATION IS NOT ABOUT SPEAKING, IT’S LISTENING 
181 
logos are devoid of any meaning. At best they serve as icons to 
identify a company and its products. A symbol cannot have any 
deep meaning until we know WHY it exists in terms bigger than 
simply to identify the company. Without clarity of WHY, a logo is 
just a logo. 
To say that a logo stands for quality, service, innovation and the 
like only reinforces its status as just a logo. These qualities are about 
the company and not about the cause. Don't forget the dictators. 
They understand the power of symbols, except the symbols are 
often of them. Likewise, so many companies act like dictators—it's 
all about them and what they want. They tell us what to do, they tell 
us what we need, they tell us they have the answers but they do not 
inspire us and they do not command our loyalty. And to take the 
analogy a step further, the way dictators maintain their power is 
through fear, reward and every other manipulation they can think 
of. People follow dictators not because they want to, but because 
they have to. For companies to be perceived as a great leaders and 
not dictators, all their symbols, including their logos, need to stand 
for something in which we can all believe. Something we can all 
support. That takes clarity, discipline and consistency. 
For a logo to become a symbol, people must be inspired to use 
that logo to say something about who they are. Couture fashion 
labels are the most obvious example of this. People use them to 
demonstrate status. But many of them are somewhat generic in 
what they symbolize. There is a more profound example: Harley- 
Davidson. 
There are people who walk around with Harley-Davidson tat-
toos on their bodies. That's insane. They've tattooed a corporate logo 
on their skin. Some of them don't even own the product! Why 
would rational people tattoo a corporate logo on their bodies? The 
reason is simple. After years of Harley being crystal clear about 
what they believe, after years of being disciplined about a set of 


--- Page 189 ---
START WITH WHY 
182 
values and guiding principles and after years of being doggedly 
consistent about everything they say and do, their logo has become 
a symbol. It no longer simply identifies a company and its products; 
it identifies a belief. 
In truth, most people who tattoo Harley-Davidson logos on their 
bodies have no idea what the stock price of Harley is. They have no 
idea about some management shake-up the week before. That 
symbol is no longer about Harley. The logo embodies an en- tire 
value set—their own. The symbol is no longer about Harley, it's 
about them. Randy Fowler, a former U.S. Marine and now general 
manager of a Harley-Davidson dealership in California, proudly 
sports a large Harley tattoo on his left arm. "It symbolizes who I 
am," he says. "Mostly, it says I'm an American." Customer and com-
pany are now one and the same. The meaning of Harley-Davidson 
has value in people's lives because, for those who believe in Harley's 
WHY, it helps them express the meaning of their own lives. 
Because of Harley's clarity, discipline and consistency, most will 
know what that symbol means, even if you don't subscribe to it 
yourself. That's the reason why when someone walks into a bar 
with a big Harley logo on his arm we take a step back and give him 
a wide berth. The symbol has become so meaningful, in fact, that 12 
percent of Harley-Davidson revenues are strictly from merchan-
dising. That's remarkable. 
It's not just logos, however, that can serve as symbols. Symbols 
are any tangible representation of a clear set of values and beliefs. 
An ink-stained finger for Iraqis was a symbol of a new beginning. A 
London double-decker bus or a cowboy hat—both are symbols of 
national cultures. But national symbols are easy because most 
nations have a clear sense of culture that has been reinforced and 
repeated for generations. It is not a company or organization that 
decides what, it symbols mean, it is the group outside the mega-
phone, in the chaotic marketplace, who decide. If, based on the 


--- Page 190 ---
COMMUNICATION IS NOT ABOUT SPEAKING, IT’S LISTENING 
183 
things they see and hear, the outsiders can clearly and consistently 
report what an organization believes, then, and only then, can a 
symbol start to take on meaning. It is the truest test of how effective 
a megaphone has been produced—when clarity is able to filter all 
the way through the organization and come to life in everything 
that comes out of it. 
Go back to Apple's "1984" commercial at the beginning of 
chapter 9. For those who have seen it, does it make you think about 
Apple and its products or do you simply like the sentiment? Or the 
line "Think Different," does it speak to you? 
If you're a Mac customer, you probably loved this commercial; it 
may even give you goose bumps when you watch it—a surefire test 
that the WHY is connecting with you on a visceral or limbic level. In 
fact, this commercial, after you learned it was from Apple, may have 
reinforced your decision to buy a Mac, whether for the first time or 
the tenth time. This commercial, like all Apple's advertising, is one 
of the things Apple has said or done that reinforces what they 
believe. It is every bit consistent with the clear belief we know they 
embody. And if the commercial speaks to you and you're not an 
Apple lover, odds are you still like the idea of thinking differently. 
The message of that ad is one of the things Apple does to tell their 
story. It is one of the WHATs to their WHY. It is a symbol. It is for 
these reasons that we say of a piece of advertising; "It really speaks 
to me." It's not really speaking to you, it's speaking to the millions of 
people who saw the ad. When we say that something like that 
"speaks to me," what we're really saying is, through all this clutter 
and noise, I can hear that. I can hear it and I will listen. This is what 
it means for a message that comes out of the megaphone to resonate. 
Everything that comes out of the base of the megaphone serves 
as a way for an organization to articulate what it believes. What a 
company says and does are the means by which the company 
speaks. Too many companies put a disproportionate amount of 


--- Page 191 ---
START WITH WHY 
184 
weight on their products or services simply because those are the 
things that bring in the money. But there are many more things at 
the base of the megaphone that play an equal role in speaking to the 
outside world. Though products may drive sales, they alone cannot 
create loyalty. In fact, a company can create loyalty among people 
who aren't even customers. I spoke favorably of Apple long before I 
bought one. And I spoke disparagingly of a certain PC brand even 
though I'd been buying their products for years. 
Apple's clarity, discipline and consistency—their ability to build 
a megaphone, not a company, that is clear and loud—is what has 
given them the ability to command such loyalty. They are accused of 
having a cultlike following. Those inside the company are often 
accused of following the "cult of Steve." All of these compliments or 
insults are indications that others have taken on the cause and made 
it their own. That experts describe their products and marketing as a 
"lifestyle" reinforces that people who love Apple products are using 
WHAT Apple does to demonstrate their own personal identity. We 
call it "lifestyle marketing" because people have integrated 
commercial products into the style of their lives. Apple, with great 
efficiency, built a perfectly clear megaphone, leveraged the Law of 
Diffusion and invited others to help spread the gospel. Not for the 
company, for themselves. 
Even their promotions and partnerships serve as tangible proof 
of what they believe. In 2003 and 2004, Apple ran a promotion for 
iTunes with Pepsi—the cola branded as "the choice of the next gen-
eration." It made sense that Apple would do a deal with Pepsi, the 
primary challenger to Coca-Cola, the status quo. Everything Apple 
does, everything they say and do, serves as tangible proof of what 
they believe. The reason I use Apple so extensively throughout this 
book is that Apple is so disciplined in HOW they do things and so 
consistent in WHAT they do that, love them or hate them, we all 
have a sense of their WHY. We know what they believe.

185 
Most of us didn't read books about them. We don't personally 
know Steve Jobs. We haven't spent time roaming the halls of Apple's 
headquarters to get to know their culture. The clarity we have for 
what Apple believes comes from one place and one place only: 
Apple. People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it, 
and Apple says and does only the things they believe. If WHAT you 
do doesn't prove what you believe, then no one will know what 
your WHY is and you'll be forced to compete on price, service, 
quality, features and benefits; the stuff of commodities. Apple has a 
clear and loud megaphone and is exceptionally good at commu-
nicating its story. 
The Celery Test 
In order to improve HOW and WHAT we do, we constantly look to 
what others are doing. We attend conferences, read books, talk to 
friends and colleagues to get their input and advice, and sometimes 
we are also the dispensers of advice. We are in pursuit of 
understanding the best practices of others to help guide us. But it is 
a flawed assumption that what works for one organization will 
work for another. Even if the industries, sizes and market conditions 
are the same, the notion that "if it's good for them, it's good for us" is 
simply not true. 
I know of a company with an amazing culture. When asked; the 
employees say they love that all the conference rooms have ping-
pong tables in them. Does that mean that if you were to put ping-
pong tables in all your conference rooms your culture would 
improve? Of course not. But this is an example of "best practices." 
The idea that copying WHAT or HOW things are done at high-
performing organizations will inherently work for you i$ just not 
true. Like the Ferrari and the Honda, what is good for on<f 


--- Page 193 ---
START WITH WHY 
186 
company is not necessarily good for another. Put simply, best prac-
tices are not always best. 
It is not just WHAT or HOW you do things that matters; what 
matters more is that WHAT and HOW you do things is consistent 
with your WHY. Only then will your practices indeed be best. There 
is nothing inherently wrong with looking to others to learn what; 
they do, the challenge is knowing what practices or advice to follow. 
Fortunately, there is a simple test you can apply to find out exactly 
WHAT and HOW is right for you. It's a simple metaphor called the 
Celery Test. 
Imagine you go to a dinner party and somebody comes up to 
you and says, "You know what you need in your organization? 
M&M's. If you're not using M&M's in your business, you're leaving 
money on the table." 
Somebody else comes up to you and says, "You know what you 
need? Rice milk. The data shows that all the people are buying rice 
milk these days. You should be selling rice milk in this economy." 
While you're standing over the punch bowl, yet another person 
offers some sage advice. "Oreo cookies," he says. "We made millions; 
from implementing Oreo cookies in our organization. You've got to 
do it." 
Still somebody else comes up to you and says, "Celery. You've 
got to get into celery." 
You get all this great advice from all these highly accomplished 
people. Some of them are in the same industry. Some of them are 
more successful than you. Some of them have offered similar advice 
to others with great success. Now, what do you do? 
You go to the supermarket and you buy celery, rice milk, Oreos 
and M&M's. You spend a lot of time at the supermarket walking the 
aisles. You spend a lot of money because you buy everything. But 
you may or may not get any value from some or all of these 
products; there are no guarantees. Worse, if you're budget-


--- Page 194 ---
COMMUNICATION IS NOT ABOUT SPEAKING, IT’S LISTENING 
187 
constrained, you had to whittle down your choices again. And then 
which do you choose? 
But one thing's for sure: when you're standing in line at the 
supermarket with all of these items in your arms, your celery, rice 
milk, Oreos and M&Ms, nobody can see what you believe. What 
you do is supposed serve as the tangible proof of what you believe, 
and you bought everything. 
But what if you knew your WHY before you went to the super-
market? What if your WHY is to do only things that are healthy? To 
always do the things that are good for your body? You'll get all the 
same good advice from all the same people, the only difference is, 
the next time you go to the supermarket, you'll buy only rice milk 
and celery. Those are the only products that make sense. It's not that 
the other advice isn't good advice, it's just not good for you. The 
advice doesn't fit. 
Filtering your decisions through your WHY, you spend less time 
at the supermarket and you spend less money, so there's an 
efficiency advantage also. You're guaranteed to get value out of all 
the products you bought. And, most importantly, when you're 
standing in line with your products in your arms, everybody can see 
what you believe. With only celery and rice milk it's obvious to 
people walking by what you believe. "I can see that you believe in 
looking after your health," they may say to you. "I feel the same 
way| I have a question for you." Congratulations. You just attracted 
^ customer, an employee, a partner or a referral simply by making 
the right decisions. Simply ensuring that WHAT you do proves 
what you believe makes it easy for those who believe what you 
believe to find you. You have successfully communicated your 
WHY* based on WHAT you do. 
This is an idealistic concept and in the real world that level of 
discipline is not always possible. I understand that sometimes we 
have to make short-term decisions to pay bills or get some shortterm 


--- Page 195 ---
START WITH WHY 
188 
advantage. That's fine. The Celery Test still applies. If you want a 
piece of chocolate cake, go right ahead. The difference is*; when you 
start with WHY, you know full well that the chocolate' cake is a 
short-term decision that doesn't fit with your beliefs. You're under 
no illusions. You know you are only doing it for the short-term 
sugar rush and you'll have to work a little harder to get it out of 
your system. It's astounding the number of businesses I see that 
view an opportunity as the one that's going to set them on a path to 
glory, only to have it blow up or slowly deflate over time.; They see 
the chocolate cake and can't resist. Starting with WHY not only 
helps you know which is the right advice for you to follow, but also 
to know which decisions will put you out of balance. You can; 
certainly make those decisions if you need to, but don't make too! 
many of them, otherwise over time, no one will know what you; 
believe. 
But here's the best part. As soon as I told you the WHY, you 
knew that we were going to buy only celery and rice milk even be-
fore you read it. As soon as I gave you the filter, as soon as I said the 
WHY, you knew exactly what decisions to make before I said so. 
That's called scale. 
With a WHY clearly stated in an organization, anyone within the 
organization can make a decision as clearly and as accurately as the 
founder. A WHY provides the clear filter for decision-making. Any 
decisions—hiring, partnerships, strategies and tactics—should all 
pass the Celery Test.

Mark Rubin is a good parent. He spends a lot of time with his two 
daughters, Lucy and Sophie. One Saturday afternoon, his wife, 
Claudine, took Lucy to a friend's for a playdate and Mark was left 
home to look after five-year-old Sophie. Feeling a little tired, Mark 
really wanted to just have a little time to relax on the couch and not

have to play tree house again for the ninth time that day. To keep 
Sophie occupied, he opted for the TV as babysitter. Mark had two 
brand-new DVDs to choose from. He'd seen neither of them and 
heard nothing about either of them in the press or from any of his 
friends with small children. Mark didn't feel like watching the car-
toon himself—the plan was to let Sophie enjoy the movie in one 
room while he watched something in the other room. One of the 
DVDs was from some company he'd never heard of and the other 
was from Disney. Which one did he put in the DVD player? Which 
one would you put in the DVD player? 
The answer is so clear it verges on a silly question, but let's con-
sider the facts for fun. Both DVDs were cartoons. Both were age- 
appropriate for a child. Both had a couple of good reviews on the 
packaging. The only difference is that we trust the DVD from Dis-
ney. Disney is not a perfect company. They occasionally have man-
agement and leadership issues. Their stock price sometimes goes 
down. They have lawsuits filed against them all the time. Some 
would lump them in with all the other nasty corporations that work 
to appease Wall Street. So why would we trust them? 
Disney operates with a clear sense of WHY—they exist to pro-
mote good, clean family fun and everything they say and do has, for 
decades, worked to prove it. The reason we trust Disney is simple; 
we know what they believe. They pass the Celery Test. They have 
been so consistent over time in everything they say and do that 
parents trust them enough to expose their children to Disney 
content without vetting it first. This has nothing to do with quality 
products. This is not rational. 
Southwest Airlines also passes the Celery Test. The company has 
been so consistent over time that we almost know what to expect 
from them. The airline offers only open seating on its flights, for 
example. It's one of the things they do to prove that they believe in 
freedom. It just makes sense. A company that serves the common

man and values equality for all so much could never have a class 
structure. If Delta or United or Continental tried to do the same, it 
wouldn't make sense, open seating doesn't fit their way. 
In Violation of Celery 
Birkenstock sandals, tie-dyed T-shirts, daisy chains and a VW van. 
All are symbols of the hippie ideals of peace, love and all things 
vegetarian. So it was a bit of a surprise in 2004 when Volkswagen 
introduced a $70,000 luxury model to their lineup. The company 
famous for putting a vase for fresh flowers on the dashboard of their 
new Beetle introduced the Phaeton in an attempt to compete with 
high-end luxury cars, including the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and the 
BMW 7 Series. The V-8,335-horsepower car boasted some of the 
most advanced features in the industry, like an air compressor 
suspension system and a draftless four-zone climate control. It even 
included an electronically controlled shiatsu massage system in the 
seats. The car was an astounding achievement. It was very 
comfortable and was a monster on the road, outperforming other 
more established luxury cars in its class. The critics loved it. But 
there was a small problem. Despite all the facts and figures, features 
and benefits, and regardless of the world-renowned German 
engineering, few people bought one. It just didn't make sense. What 
VW had done was inconsistent with what we knew them to believe. 
Volkswagen, which translated means "people's car," had spent 
generations making cars for you and me. Everyone knew what VW 
stood for—power to the people. It brought its cause to life in prod-
ucts that were all about quality that the average person could afford. 
In a single swoop of German ingenuity, VW had been put 
completely out of balance. This is not like Dell coming out with an 
mp3 player or United starting the low-cost airline Ted. In those 
cases, we had no idea what the companies' WHYs were. Absent any 


--- Page 198 ---
COMMUNICATION IS NOT ABOUT SPEAKING, IT’S LISTENING 
191 
knowledge or feeling for their WHY, we couldn't bring ourselves to 
buy products from them that went anything beyond WHAT they 
do. In this case, VW has a clear WHY, but WHAT they produced 
was completely misaligned. They failed the Celery Test. 
Toyota and Honda knew this better than Volkswagen. When they 
decided to add luxury models to their lineups, they created new 
brands, Lexus and Acura respectively, to do it. Toyota had become a 
symbol of efficiency and affordability to the general population. 
They had built their business on a suite of low-cost cars. They knew 
that the market would not pay a premium for a luxury car with the 
same name or with the same logo on the hood. Although a luxury 
car, Lexus is still another WHAT to Toyota's WHY. It still embodies 
the same cause as the Toyota-branded cars, and the values of the 
company are the same. The only difference is WHAT they are doing 
to bring that cause to life. 
The good news is, VW hasn't made the same mistake again, and 
their WHY remains clear. But if a company tries too many times to 
"seize market opportunities" inconsistent with their WHY over time, 
their WHY will go fuzzy and their ability to inspire and command 
loyalty will deteriorate. 
What companies say and do matters. A lot. It is at the WHAT 
level that a cause is brought to life. It is at this level that a company 
speaks to the outside world and it is then that we can learn what the 
company believes.

WHEN WHY GOES FUZZY 
Goliath Flinched 
"A lot of what goes on these days with high-flying companies and 
these overpaid CEOs, who're really just looting from the top and 
aren't watching out for anybody but themselves, really upsets me. 
It's one of the main things wrong with American business today." 
This is the sentiment passed down from the founder of one of the 
most vilified companies in recent history. 
Raised on a farm in America's heartland, he came of age during 
the Great Depression. This probably explained his predisposition for 
frugality. Standing five feet nine inches and weighing only 130 
pounds when he played football in high school, Sam Walton, the 
founder of Wal-Mart, learned early the value of working hard. 
Working hard leads to winning. And as the quarterback on his high 
school football team, he won a lot. In fact, they went on to become 
state champs. Whether through hard work, luck or just an unflap-
pable optimism, Walton got so used to winning all the time that he 
couldn't fully visualize what losing looked like. He simply couldn't 
imagine it. Walton even philosophized that always thinking about 
winning probably became a self-fulfilling prophecy for him. Even 


--- Page 203 ---

196 
during the Depression, he had a highly successful paper route that 
earned him a decent wage for the times. 
By the time Sam Walton died, he had taken Wal-Mart from a; 
single store in Bentonville, Arkansas, and turned it into a retail 
colossus with $44 billion in annual sales with 40 million people 
shopping in the stores per week. But it takes more than a competi-
tive nature, a strong work ethic and a sense of optimism to build a 
company big enough to equal the twenty-third-largest economy in 
the world. 
Walton wasn't the first person with big dreams to start a small 
business. Many small business owners dream of making it big. I 
meet a lot of entrepreneurs and it is amazing how many of them tell 
me their goal is to build a billion-dollar company. The odds; 
however, are significantly stacked against them. There are 27.7 
million registered businesses in the United States today and only a 
thousand of them get to be FORTUNE 1000 companies, which these 
days requires about $1.5 billion in annual revenues. That1 means 
that less than .004 percent of all companies make it to the illustrious 
list. To have such an impact, to build a company to a size where it 
can drive markets, requires something more. 
Sam Walton did not invent the low-cost shopping model. The 
five-and-dime variety store concept had existed for decades and 
Kmart and Target opened their doors the same year as Wal-Mart, in 
1962. Discounting was already a $2 billion industry when Walton 
decided to build his first Wal-Mart. There was plenty of competition 
beyond Kmart and Target, some of it much better funded and with 
better locations and seemingly better opportunities for success than 
Wal-Mart. Sam Walton didn't even invent a better way of doing 
things than everyone else. He admitted to "borrowing" many, of his 
ideas about the business from Sol Price, the founder of Fed- Mart, a 
retail discounter founded in Southern California during the 1950s. 


--- Page 204 ---
WHEN WHY GOES FUZZY 
197 
Wal-Mart was not the only retail establishment capable of offering 
low prices either. Price, as we've already established, is a highly 
effective manipulation. But it alone does not inspire people to root 
for you and give you the undying loyalty needed to create a tipping 
point to grow to massive proportions. Being cheap does not inspire 
employees to give their blood, sweat and tears. Wal-Mart did not 
have a lock on cheap prices and cheap prices are not what made it 
so beloved and ultimately so successful. 
For Sam Walton, there was something else, a deeper purpose, 
cause or belief that drove him. More than anything else, Walton 
believed in people. He believed that if he looked after people, 
people would look after him. The more Wal-Mart could give to 
employees, customers and the community, the more that employ-
ees, customers and the community would give back to Wal-Mart. 
"We're all working together; that's the secret," said Walton. 
This was a much bigger concept than simply "passing on the 
savings." To Walton, the inspiration came not simply from customer 
service but from service itself. Wal-Mart was WHAT Walton built to 
serve his fellow human beings. To serve the community, to serve 
employees and to serve customers. Service was a higher cause. 
The problem was that his cause was not clearly handed down 
after he died. In the post-Sam era, Wal-Mart slowly started to 
confuse WHY it existed—to serve people—with HOW it did 
business—to offer low prices. They traded the inspiring cause of 
serving people for a manipulation. They forgot Walton's WHY and 
their driving motivation became all about "cheap." In stark contrast 
to the founding cause that Wal-Mart originally embodied, efficiency 
and margins became the name of the game. "A computer can tell 
you down to the dime what you've sold, but it can never tell you 
how much you could have sold," said Walton. There is always a 
price to pay for the money you make, and given Wal-Mart's sheer 
size, that cost wasn't paid in dollars and cents alone. In Wal-Mart's

case, forgetting their founder's WHY has come at a very high human 
cost. Ironic, considering the company's founding cause. 
The company once renowned for how it treated employees and 
customers has been scandal-ridden for nearly a decade. Nearly 
every scandal has centered on how poorly they treat their customers 
and their employees. As of December 2008, Wal-Mart faced seventy-
three class-action lawsuits related to wage violations and' has 
already paid hundreds of millions of dollars in past judgments and 
settlements. A company that believed in the symbiotic relationship 
between corporation and community managed to drive for wedge 
between themselves and so many of the communities which they 
operate. There was a time when legislators would help pass laws to 
allow Wal-Mart into new communities; now lawmakers rally to 
keep them out. Fights to block Wal-Mart from opening new stores 
have erupted across the country. In New York, for example, city 
representatives in Brooklyn joined forces with labor unions to block 
the store because of Wal-Mart's reputation for unfair labor practices. 
In one of the more ironic violations of Walton's founding beliefs, 
Wal-Mart has been unable to laugh at itself or learn from its 
scandals. "Celebrate your successes," said Walton. "Find some 
humor in your failures. Don't take yourself so seriously. Loosen up 
and everybody around you will loosen up." Instead of admitting 
that things aren't what they used to be, Wal-Mart has done the 
opposite. 
The way Wal-Mart thinks, acts and communicates since the 
passing of their inspired leader is not a result of their competitor 
outsmarting them either. Kmart filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection in 2002, and then merged with Sears three years later. 
With about $400 billion in annual sales, Wal-Mart still sells more 
than six times as much as Target each year. In fact, looking beyond 
discount retailing, Wal-Mart is now the largest supermarket in the 
world and sells more DVDs, bicycles and toys than any other

company in America. Outside competition is not what's hurting 
their company. The greatest challenge Wal-Mart has faced over the 
year comes from one place: itself. 
For Wal-Mart, WHAT they do and HOW they are doing it; hasn't 
changed. And it has nothing to do with Wal-Mart being 
"corporation"; they were one of those before the love started decline. 
What has changed is that their WHY went fuzzy. And we all know 
it. A company once so loved is simply not as loved any-1 
more. The negative feelings we have for the company are real, but 
the part of the brain that is able to explain why we feel so negatively 
toward them has trouble explaining what changed. So we rational-
ize and point to the most tangible things we can see—size and 
money. If we, as outsiders, have lost clarity of Wal-Mart's WHY, it's 
a good sign that the WHY has gone fuzzy inside the company also. 
If it's not clear on the inside, it will never be clear on the outside. 
What is clear is that the Wal-Mart of today is not the Wal-Mart that 
Sam Walton built. So what happened? 
It's too easy to say that all they care about is their bottom line. All 
companies are in business to make money, but being successful at it 
is not the reason why things change so drastically. That only points 
to a symptom. Without understanding the reason it happened in the 
first place, the pattern will repeat for every other company that 
makes it big. It is not destiny or some mystical business cycle that 
transforms successful companies into impersonal goliaths. It's 
people. 
Being Successful vs. Feeling Successful 
Every year a group of high-performing entrepreneurs get 
together at MIT's Endicott House just outside Boston. This 
Gathering of Titans, as they call themselves, is not your average 
entrepreneurial conference. It's not a boondoggle. There's no golf, 
there's no spa and there are no expensive dinners. Every year forty

to fifty business owners spend four days listening, from early in the 
morning until well into the evening. An assortment of guest 
speakers is invited to present their thinking and ideas, and then 
there are discussions led by some of the attendees. 
I had the honor of attending the Gathering of Titans as a guest a 
few years ago. I expected it to be another group of entrepreneurs 
getting together to talk shop. I expected to hear discussions and 
presentations about maximizing profits and improving systems. But 
what I witnessed was profoundly different. In fact, it was the 
complete opposite. 
On the first day, someone asked the group how many of them 
had achieved their financial goals. About 80 percent of the hands 
went up. I thought that alone was quite impressive. But it was the 
answer to the next question that was so profound. With their hands 
still in the air, the group was then asked, "How many of you fed 
successful?" And 80 percent of the hands went down. 
Here was a room full of some of America's brightest entrepre-
neurs, many of them multimillionaires, some of whom don't need to 
work anymore if they don't want to, yet most of them still didn't feel 
like they had succeeded. In fact, many of them reported that they'd 
lost something since they started their businesses. They reminisced 
about the days when they didn't have any money and were working 
out of their basements, trying to get things going. They longed for 
the feeling they used to have. 
These amazing entrepreneurs were at a point in their lives where 
they realized that their businesses were about much more than sell-
ing stuff or making money. They realized the deep personal 
connection that existed between WHAT they do and WHY they 
were doing it. This group of entrepreneurs gathered to discuss 
matters of WHY, and at times it was quite intense. 
Unlike the typical Type-A-personality entrepreneurs, the Titans 
were not there to prove anything to each other. There was a feeling 


--- Page 208 ---
WHEN WHY GOES FUZZY 
201 
of immense trust rather than ruthless competition. And because of 
this feeling, every member of the group was willing to express vul-
nerability that they probably rarely let show the rest of the year. 
Over the course of the event, every person in the room would shed a 
tear or two at least once. 
It doesn't interest me to write about the idea that money doesn't 
buy happiness, or in this case, the feeling of success. This is neither 
profound nor a new idea. What does interest me, however, is the 
transition that these entrepreneurs went through. As their com-
panies grew, and they became more and more successful, what 
changed? 
It is easy to see what they gained over the course of their careers—
we can easily count the money, the size of the office, the number of 
employees, the size of their homes, market share and the number of 
press clippings. But the thing they had lost is much harder to 
identify. As their tangible success grew, something more elusive 
started to dissipate. Every single one of these successful business 
owners knew WHAT they did. They knew HOW they did it. But for 
many, they no longer knew WHY. 
Achievement vs. Success 
For some people, there is an irony to success. Many people who 
achieve great success don't always feel it. Some who achieve fame 
talk about the loneliness that often goes with it. That's because suc-
cess and achievement are not the same thing, yet too often we mis-
take one for the other. Achievement is something you reach or 
attain, like a goal. It is something tangible, clearly defined and mea-
surable. Success, in contrast, is a feeling or a state of being. "She feels 
successful. She is successful," we say, using the verb to be to suggest 
this state of being. While we can easily lay down a path to reach a 
goal, laying down a path to reach that intangible feeling of success is 
more elusive. In my vernacular, achievement comes when you 


--- Page 209 ---
START WITH WHY 
202 
pursue and attain WHAT you want. Success comes when you are 
clear in pursuit of WHY you want it. The former is motivated by 
tangible factors while the latter by something deeper in the brain, 
where we lack the capacity to put those feelings into words. 
Success comes when we wake up every day in that never-ending 
pursuit of WHY we do WHAT we do. Our achievements, WHAT 
we do, serve as the milestones to indicate we are on the right path. It 
is not an either/or—we need both. A wise man once said, "Money 
can't buy happiness, but it pays for the yacht to pull alongside it." 
There is great truth in this statement. The yacht represents 
achievement; it is easily seen and, with the right plan, completely 
attainable. The thing we pull alongside represents that hard-to- 
define feeling of success. Obviously, this is much harder to see and 
attain. They are distinct concepts, and sometimes they go together 
and sometimes they don't. More importantly, some people, while in 
pursuit of success, simply mistake WHAT they achieve as the final 
destination. This is the reason they never feel satisfied no matter 
how big their yacht is, no matter how much they achieve. The false 
assumption we often make is that if we simply achieve more, the 
feeling of success will follow. But it rarely does. 
In the course of building a business or a career, we become more 
confident in WHAT we do. We become greater experts in HOW to 
do it. With each achievement, the tangible measurements of success 
and the feeling of progress increase. Life is good. However, for most 
of us, somewhere in the journey we forget WHY we set out on the 
journey in the first place. Somewhere in the course of all those 
achievements an inevitable split happens. This is true for 
individuals and organizations alike. What the Endicott entrepre-
neurs experienced as individuals was the same transition that Wal- 
Mart and other big companies either have gone through or are 
going through. Because Wal-Mart operates at such an immense 


--- Page 210 ---
WHEN WHY GOES FUZZY 
203 
scale, the impact of their fuzzy WHY is felt on a greater scale. Em-
ployees, customers and the community will feel it also. 
Those with an ability to never lose sight of WHY, no matter how 
little or how much they achieve, can inspire us. Those with the 
ability to never lose sight of WHY and also achieve the milestones 
that keep everyone focused in the right direction are the great lead-
ers. For great leaders, The Golden Circle is in balance. They are in 
pursuit of WHY, they hold themselves accountable to HOW they do 
it and WHAT they do serves as the tangible proof of what they 
believe. But most of us, unfortunately, reach a place where WHAT 
we are doing and WHY we are doing it eventually fall out of balance. 
We get to a point when WHY and WHAT are not aligned. It is the 
separation of the tangible and the intangible that marks the split.

SPLIT HAPPENS 
Wal-Mart started small. So did Microsoft. So did Apple. So did 
General Electric and Ford and almost every other company that 
made it big. They didn't start by acquisition or spin-off, or achieve 
mass scale overnight. Nearly every company or organization starts 
the same way: with an idea. No matter whether an organization 
grows to become a multibillion-dollar corporation like Wal-Mart or 
fails in the first few years, most of them started with a single person 
or small group of people who had an idea. Even the United States of 
America started the same way. 
At the beginning, ideas are fueled by passion—that very com-
pelling emotion that causes us to do quite irrational things. That 
passion drives many people to make sacrifices so that a cause bigger 
than themselves can be brought to life. Some drop out of school or 
quit a perfectly good job with a good salary and benefits to try to go 
it alone. Some work extraordinarily long hours without a second 
thought, sometimes sacrificing the stability of their relationships or 
even their personal health. This passion is so intoxicating and 
exciting that it can affect others as well. Inspired by the founder's 
vision, many early employees demonstrate classic early- adopter 
behavior. Relying on their gut, these first employees also quit their 


--- Page 213 ---
START WITH WHY 
206 
perfectly good jobs and accept lower salaries to join an organization 
with a 90 percent statistical chance of failing. But the statistics don't 
matter; passion and optimism reign and energy is high. Like all 
early adopters, the behavior of those who join early says more about 
them than it does about the company's prospects. 
The reason so many small businesses fail, however, is because 
passion alone can't cut it. For passion to survive, it needs structure. 
A WHY without the HOWs, passion without structure, has a very 
high probability of failure. Remember the dot-com boom? Lots of 
passion, but not so much structure. The Titans at Endicott House, 
however, did not face this problem. They knew how to build the 
systems and processes to see their companies grow. They are among 
the statistical 10 percent of small businesses that didn't fail in their 
first three years. In fact, many of them went on to do quite well. 
Their challenge was different. Passion may need structure to sur-
vive, but for structure to grow, it needs passion. 
This is what I witnessed at the Gathering of Titans: I saw a room 
full of people with passion enough to start businesses, and with 
knowledge enough to build the systems and structures to survive 
and even do very well. But having spent so many years focused on 
converting a vision into a viable business, many started to fixate on 
WHAT the organization did or HOW to do it. Poring over financial 
or some other easily measured result, and fixating on HOW they 
were to achieve those tangible results, they stopped focusing on 
WHY they started the business in the first place. This is also what 
has happened at Wal-Mart. A company obsessed with serving the 
community became obsessed with achieving its goals. 
Like Wal-Mart, the Endicott entrepreneurs used to think, act and 
communicate from the inside out of The Golden Circle—5 from 
WHY to WHAT. But as they grew more successful, the process 
reversed. WHAT now comes first and all their systems and pro-
cesses are in pursuit of those tangible results. The reason the change 


--- Page 214 ---
SPLIT HAPPENS 
207 
happened is simple—they suffered a split and their WHY went 
fuzzy. 
 
The single greatest challenge any organization will face is . . . 
success. When the company is small, the founder will rely on his gut 
to make all the major decisions. From marketing to product, from 
strategy to tactics, hiring and firing, the decisions the founder makes 
will, if he trusts his gut, feel right. But as the organization grows, as 
it becomes more successful, it becomes physically impossible for one 
person to make every major decision. Not only must others be 
trusted and relied upon to make big decisions, but those people will 
also start making hiring choices. And slowly but surely, as the 
megaphone grows, the clarity of WHY starts to dilute. 
Whereas gut was the filter for early decisions, rational cases and 
empirical data often serve as the sole basis for later decisions. For all 
organizations that go through the split, they are no longer inspired 
by a cause greater than themselves. They simply come to work, 
manage systems and work to reach certain preset goals. There is no 
longer a cathedral to build. The passion is gone and inspiration is at 
a minimum. At that point, for most who show up every day what 
they do is just a job. If this is how the people on the inside feel, 
imagine how those on the outside feel. It is no wonder that 


--- Page 215 ---
START WITH WHY 
208 
manipulations start to dominate not only how the company sells its 
wares, but even how they retain employees. Bonuses, promotions 
and other enticements, even instilling fear in people, become the 
only way to hold on to talent. That's hardly inspiring. 
This diagram depicts the life of an organization. The top line 
represents the growth of WHAT the organization does. For a 
company, that measurement is usually money—profits, revenues, 
EBITA, share price or growth in market share. But the metric can be 
anything, depending on what the organization does. If the 
organization rescues lost puppies, then the metric would be the 
number of puppies successfully rescued. It is inherently simple to 
measure the growth of WHAT an organization does. WHATs, after 
all, are tangible and easy to count. 
The second line represents the WHY, the clarity of the founding; 
purpose, cause or belief. The goal is to ensure that as the 
measurement of WHAT grows, the clarity of the WHY stays closely 
aligned. Put another way, as the volume of the megaphone 
increases, the message traveling through it must stay clear. 
The volume of the megaphone comes solely from growth of 
WHAT. As this metric grows, any company can become a "leading" 
company. But it is the ability to inspire, to maintain clarity of WHY, 
that gives only a few people and organizations the ability to lead. 
The moment at which the clarity of WHY starts to go fuzzy is the 
split. At this point organizations may be loud, but they are no longer 
clear. 
When organizations are small, WHAT they do and WHY they do 
it are in close parallel. Born out of the personality of the founder it is 
relatively easy for early employees to "get it." Clarity of WHY 
understood because the source of passion is near—in fact it 
physically comes to work every day. In most small businesses all the 
employees are all crammed into the same room and socialize 
together. Simply being around a charismatic founder allows that 


--- Page 216 ---
SPLIT HAPPENS 
209 
feeling of being a part of something special to flourish. Although 
they may be some efficiencies to be gained, for small businesses that 
at perfectly comfortable staying small, the need to articulate the 
WHY is not as important. For organizations that want to pass the 
School Bus Test, to become billion-dollar organizations or work at a 
scale large enough to shift markets or society, the need to manage 
through the split is paramount. 
The School Bus Test is a simple metaphor. If a founder or leader 
of an organization were to be hit by a school bus, would the orga-
nization continue to thrive at the same pace without them at the 
helm? So many organizations are built on the force of a single per-
sonality that their departure can cause significant disruption. The 
question isn't if it happens—all founders eventually leave or die— 
it's just a question of when and how prepared the organization is for 
the inevitable departure. The challenge isn't to cling to the leader; it's 
to find effective ways to keep the founding vision alive forever. 
To pass the School Bus Test, for an organization to continue to 
inspire and lead beyond the lifetime of its founder, the founder's 
WHY must be extracted and integrated into the culture of the 
company. What's more, a strong succession plan should aim to find 
a leader inspired by the founding cause and ready to lead it into the 
next generation. Future leaders and employees alike must be in-
spired by something bigger than the force of personality of the 
founder and must see beyond profit and shareholder value alone. 
Microsoft has experienced a split, but is not so far down the line 
that it can't be put back on track. There was a time not too long ago 
that people at Microsoft showed up at work every day to change the 
world. And they did. What Microsoft achieved, putting a PC on 
every desk, dramatically changed the way we live. But then their 
WHY went fuzzy. Few people at the company today are instructed 
to do everything they can to help people be more productive so that 


--- Page 217 ---
START WITH WHY 
210 
they can achieve their greatest potential. Instead, Microsoft became 
just a software company. 
If you visit Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, 
you will find that although their WHY has gone fuzzy, it is not lost. 
That sense of a cause, that desire to change the world again, is still 
there, but it has become unfocused, wrapped up in HOW and 
WHAT they do. Microsoft has a remarkable opportunity to clarify 
their WHY and regain the inspiration that took them to where they 
are today. If they do not, if all they do is manage the WHAT and 
continue to ignore the WHY, they will end up looking like America 
Online, a company so far past the split that their WHY is indeed 
lost. There is barely a hint of the original WHY left anymore. 
America Online used to inspire. Like Google today, it was the 
hot company to work for. People clamored to move to Virginia to 
work for this amazing company that was changing the rules of 
business. And it was true that, like all inspiring companies, AOL set 
in motion changes that profoundly altered how we do almost ev-
erything. They inspired a nation to get online. Their cause was clear 
and their decisions were governed by their WHY. Their goal was to 
get more people online, even if their decisions in pursuit of that goal 
wreaked havoc on their business in the short term. With their WHY 
in focus, AOL pulled ahead of their competition by deciding to 
change from hourly pricing for Internet access to unlimited monthly 
pricing, a decision that created so much traffic it shut down their 
servers. Given the impact, the decision was neither practical nor 
rational, but it was the right choice to help bring their cause to life. 
That their systems shut down with the additional traffic only 
pushed them to work harder to cope with it, to ensure that America 
could, in fact, get and stay online. 
In those days, having an AOL e-mail address was a point of 
pride—a sign of being one of those who was a part of the Internet 
revolution. These days, still having an AOL e-mail address is a sym-


--- Page 218 ---
SPLIT HAPPENS 
211 
bol of having been left behind. That the meaning of something as 
simple as @aol.com has changed so dramatically is additional proof 
that the company's cause has long since departed. Absent a clear 
WHY, size and momentum are all AOL has to keep them going. The 
company is not inspiring anymore, not to those who work there and 
not to those on the outside. We don't talk about them like we used 
to and we certainly don't feel the same way about them either. We 
don't compare them to Google or Facebook or any of the other 
industry-changing companies of today. Like a massive freight train 
with brakes applied, it will still take miles for this train to come to a 
complete stop. It's simple physics. At best AOL's size will help them 
putter along, but without a more compelling purpose, cause or 
belief, the company is simply a collection of stuff. It will probably 
end up being chopped up and sold off for scrap (technology or 
customers), which is a sad reality considering how inspiring AOL 
used to be. 
It is not a coincidence that successful entrepreneurs long for the 
early days. It is no accident that big companies talk about a "return 
to basics." What they are alluding to is a time before the split. And 
they would be right. They do indeed need to return to a time when 
WHAT they did was in perfect parallel to WHY they did it. If they 
continue down the path of focusing on their growth of WHAT at the 
expense of WHY—more volume and less clarity—their ability to 
thrive and inspire for years to come is dubious at best. Companies 
like Wal-Mart, Microsoft, Starbucks, the Gap, Dell and so many 
others that used to be special have all gone through a split. If they 
cannot recapture their WHY and reinspire those inside and outside 
their organization, every one of them will end up looking more like 
AOL than the companies they were.

What Gets Measured, Gets Done 
In the fall of her freshman year in college, Christina Harbridge set 
out to find a part-time job. Intrigued by the prospect of working in 
the antiques business, she answered a newspaper ad in Sacramento 
to do office work for a "collector." Harbridge soon found out, how-
ever, that the job was filing papers for a collections agent, and even 
then she wasn't entirely sure what that meant. 
The collections office consisted of a huge room with dozens of 
phone stations, each staffed by a debt collector making call after call 
to a long list of businesses and individuals who owed money. The 
setup of the room meant there was no privacy—everyone could 
hear everyone else's calls. Harbridge was immediately taken by the 
harshness of the tone that all the collectors used with those from 
whom they aimed to collect unpaid debts. "They would hound 
them, and practically threaten them," she said. "They would do 
anything it took to get information from them." 
Harbridge recognized that the owner of the company and 
collectors were all kind, gracious people. They helped each other 
out, listened to each other's problems and even joined together 
sponsor a homeless family during the holidays. But when they wait 
on the phone to collect a debt, these same people turned passive-
aggressive, rude and often mean. It's not because they were bad 
people, it's because they were incentivized to be that way. 
Their officious behavior made perfect sense. "What gets 
measured gets done," as well-known sales coach Jack Daly says. 
And ii| the world of debt collecting, the callers were given bonuses 
b on how much money they collected. This has resulted in any 
industry that threatens, badgers, hounds and provokes. It did take 
long until Harbridge found herself adopting the same attitude 
whenever she talked with debtors. "I began treating people on the 
phone the way everybody else in the office treated them," she sail 


--- Page 220 ---
SPLIT HAPPENS 
213 
Feeling like WHAT she was doing was completely out of balance 
with her WHY, Harbridge decided there had to be another way to 
go in my head that I was going to start an agency that collected by 
being nice," she said. People in the collections business though 
Harbridge naive, if not crazy. And maybe she was. 
In 1993, Harbridge moved to San Francisco and started her own 
collections firm, Bridgeport Financial, steeped in the belief that 
agents would have more success treating people with respect that 
badgering them. Harbridge built her company on her WHY—that 
everyone has a story and everyone deserves to be listened to Her 
approach was to have her agents try to establish rapport with the 
debtor on the other end of the phone in the course of a three minute 
conversation. The goal was to learn everything they could about the 
person's circumstances: Did they have the means to pa] the debt? 
Would they honor a payment plan? Was the reason for the failure to 
pay reflective of a short-term situation? "We would get people to tell 
us the truth," she said. "Sure, we had a legal department, but we 
tried to avoid using it." Harbridge knew, however, that no matter 
her intentions, if she measured the results the same was as others, 
the same awful behavior would result. So she came with an entirely 
new way to incentivize her people. She found a way to measure 
WHY. 
At Bridgeport Financial, bonuses were not given for the amount 
of money that was collected; they were given based on how many 
"thank you" cards her agents sent out. This is harder than it sounds. 
Sending out a card thanking someone for the time they spent talking 
on the phone requires a few things. First, Harbridge had to hire 
people who believed what she believed. She had to hire good fits. If 
her employees didn't believe that everyone deserves to be listened 
to, it wouldn't work. Only good-fit hires would be capable of creat-
ing an environment on the telephone that would actually warrant 
sending a thank-you card, even though the purpose of the call was 


--- Page 221 ---
START WITH WHY 
214 
to ask for money. Harbridge measured WHY her company existed, 
not WHAT they did, and the result was a culture in which compas-
sion was valued above all. 
But what about the other results? What about her financial re-
sults, the ones most businesses pursue first? Bridgeport Financial 
collected 300 percent more than the industry average. What's more, 
most of the people and companies who were initially being pursued 
ended up doing more business with the original company that sent 
the collections agency after them in the first place. This is almost 
unprecedented in the collections industry. 
Harbridge's business succeeded not just because she knew WHY 
she was doing what she was doing, but because she found a way to 
measure the WHY. The company's growth was loud and her cause 
was clear. She started with WHY and the rest followed. 
Most organizations today use very clear metrics to track the 
progress and growth of WHAT they do—usually it's money. Un-
fortunately, we have very poor measurements to ensure that a WHY 
stays clear. Dwayne Honore has for the past ten years run his own 
commercial construction company in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, a 
trade he learned from his father. A leader with a deep sense of pur-
pose, he devised some years ago a brilliant system to ensure that his 
values are reinforced in his company's culture. He figured out how 
to measure something most people can only pay lip service to: 
work-life balance. Honore believes that people should not spend all 
their time at work, but rather they should work to spend more of 
their time with their families. 
Every employee at Honors Construction is required to clock in 
the morning and clock out in the evening. But there's a catch They 
must clock in between 8:00-8:30 a.m. and out by 5:00-5:3|j P.M. Stay 
any later and they are taken out of a bonus pool. Because employees 
know they have to leave by 5:30 p.m., wasted time has dropped to a 
minimum. Productivity is high and turnover in low. Consider how 


--- Page 222 ---

215 
much you get done the day before you go on vacation. Now 
imagine every day is like that. That's what Dwayne Honore figured 
out how to do. Because he figured out how to mea$ sure a value he 
holds dear, that value is embraced. Most importantly, because 
Honore's actions pass the Celery Test, others can clearly see what he 
believes. 
Money is a perfectly legitimate measurement of goods sold or 
services rendered. But it is no calculation of value. Just because 
somebody makes a lot of money does not mean that he necessarily 
provides a lot of value. Likewise, just because somebody makes 
little money does not necessarily mean he provides only a little 
value. Simply by measuring the number of goods sold or the money 
brought in is no indication of value. Value is a feeling, not a 
calculation. It is perception. One could argue that a product with 
more bells and whistles that sells for less is the greater value. But by 
who’s standard? 
My uncle used to make tennis rackets. His rackets were made the 
exact same factory as a name-brand racket. They were made of the 
same material on the same machine. The only difference with that 
when my uncle's rackets came off the assembly line, they didn’t put 
the well-known brand logo on the product. My uncle's racked sold 
for less money, in the same big-box retailer, next to the name brand 
rackets. Month after month, the name-brand rackets outsold the 
generic-brand ones. Why? Because people perceived greater value 
from the name-brand rackets and felt just fine paying a premium for 
that feeling. On a strictly rational scale, the generic rackets offered 
better value. But again, value is a perception, not a calculation, 
which is the reason companies make such a big deal about investing 
in their brand. But a strong brand, like all other intangible factors 
that contribute to the perception of value, starts with a clear sense of 
WHY.

If those outside the megaphone share your WHY and if you are 
able to clearly communicate that belief in everything you say and 
do, trust emerges and value is perceived. When that happens, loyal 
buyers will always rationalize the premium they pay or the incon-
venience they suffer to get that feeling. To them, the sacrifice of time 
or money is worth it. They will try to explain that their feeling of 
value comes from quality or features or some other easy-to- point-to 
element, but it doesn't. Those are external factors and the feeling they 
get comes completely from inside them. When people can point to a 
company and clearly articulate what the company believes and use 
words unrelated to price, quality, service and features, that is proof 
the company has successfully navigated the split. When people 
describe the value they perceive with visceral, excited words like 
"love," that is a sure sign that a clear sense of WHY exists. 
Good Successions Keep the WHY Alive 
There were three words missing from Bill Gates's goodbye speech 
when he officially left Microsoft in June 2008. They are three words 
he probably doesn't even realize need to be there. 
"I'll be back." 
Though Gates abdicated his role as CEO of Microsoft to Steve 
Ballmer in 2000 to lend more time and energy to the Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation, he still maintained a role and a presence 
at the Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. His plan 
was always to completely leave the company in the care of others, 
but like a lot of founders, Gates forgot to do one thing that would 
allow his plan to work. This one oversight could have a devastating 
impact on Microsoft and may even require him to come back 
someday to right the ship he built. 
Bill Gates is special. Not just because of his brain or his 
management style. Though important, those two things alone are 


--- Page 224 ---
SPLIT HAPPENS 
217 
not the formula for building a $60 billion corporation from scratch. 
Like all visionary leaders, Bill Gates is special because he embodies 
what he believes. He is the personification of Microsoft's WHY. And 
for that reason, he serves as a physical beacon, a reminder of WHY 
everyone comes to work. 
When Gates founded Microsoft with Paul Allen in 1975, he did 
so to advance a higher cause: if you give people the right tools, and 
make them more productive, then everyone, no matter their lot in 
life, will have an opportunity to achieve their real potential, "A PC 
in every home and on every desk," he envisioned; remarkable from 
a company that didn't even make PCs. He saw the PC as the great 
equalizer. Microsoft's most successful software, Windows, allowed 
anyone to have access to powerful technology. Tools like Word, 
Excel and PowerPoint gave everyone the power to realize the 
promise of the new technology—to become more efficient and 
productive. Small businesses, for example, could look and act like 
big businesses. Microsoft's software helped Gates advance his cause 
to empower the "everyman." 
Make no mistake, Microsoft has done more to change the world 
than Apple. Though we are drawn to Apple's well-deserved rep-
utation for innovation and challenging the business models of more 
than one industry, it is Microsoft that was responsible for the 
advancement of the personal computer. Gates put a PC on every 
desk and in doing so he changed the world. As the physical em-
bodiment of the company's WHY, the "everyman" who fulfilled an 
amazing potential, what happens now that he's gone? 
Gates himself has always held that he receives a "disproportionate" 
amount of attention for his role at Microsoft, much of it, of course, 
due to his exceptional wealth. Like all inspired leaders, he 
recognizes that his role is to lead the cause, but it is others who will 
be physically responsible for bringing that cause to life. Martin Lu-
ther King Jr. could not have changed America walking across a

bridge in Selma, Alabama, with five prominent civil rights leaders. 
It took the thousands of people marching behind them to spur 
change. Gates recognizes the need for people to produce real 
change, but he neglected to remember that any effective movement, 
social or business, needs a leader to march in the front, preaching 
the vision and reminding people WHY they showed up in the first 
place. Though King needed to cross the bridge from Selma on his 
march to Montgomery, it was what it meant to cross the bridge that 
mattered. Likewise in business, though profit and shareholder value 
are valid and essential destinations, they do not inspire people to 
come to work. 
Although Microsoft went through the split years ago, changing 
from a company that intended to change the world into a company 
that makes software, having Gates hanging around helped Micro-
soft maintain at least a loose sense of WHY they existed. With Gates 
gone, Microsoft does not have sufficient systems to measure and 
preach their WHY anymore. This is an issue that will have an ex-
ponential impact as time passes. 
Such a departure as Gates's is not without precedent among 
companies with equally visionary leaders. Steve Jobs, the physical 
embodiment of the rabble-rousing revolutionary, a man who also 
personifies his company's WHY, left Apple in 1985 after a legendary 
power struggle with Apple's president, John Sculley, and the Apple 
board of directors. The impact on Apple was profound. 
Originally hired by Jobs in 1983, Sculley was a perfectly capable 
executive with a proven track record. He know WHAT to do and 
HOW to do things. He was considered one of the most talented 
marketing executives around, having risen quickly through the 
ranks of PepsiCo. At Pepsi, he created the wildly successful Pepsi 
Challenge taste test advertising campaign, leading Pepsi to overtake 
Coca-Cola for the first time. But the problem was, Sculley was a bad 


--- Page 226 ---
SPLIT HAPPENS 
219 
fit at Apple. He ran the company as a business and was not there to 
lead the cause. 
It is worth considering how such a bad fit as Sculley even got the 
job at Apple in the first place. Simple—he was manipulated. Sculley 
did not approach Jobs and ask to be a part of Apple's cause. The 
way the real story unfolded made the fallout almost predictably 
Jobs knew he needed help. He knew he needed a HOW guy to help 
him scale his vision. He approached Sculley, a man with a solid 
r£sum6, and said, "Do you want to sell sugar water your whole life 
or do you want to change the world?" Playing off Sculley's ego 
aspirations and fears, Jobs completed a perfectly executed manipu-
lation. And with it, Jobs was ousted from his own company a fen* 
years later. 
Apple thrived on Steve Jobs's fumes for a few years as businesses 
started buying up Macintoshes and software developers continued 
to create new software. But it wouldn't be long until the company 
would begin to falter. Apple just wasn't what it used to be. It had 
gone through the split and ignored it. The WHY was getting fuzzier 
and fuzzier with each passing year. The inspiration was gone. 
Literally. 
With a capable executive like Sculley running the business, there 
was no one to lead the cause. New products would be "less revolu-
tionary and more evolutionary," reported FORTUNE magazine at 
the time, "some people might even call them dull." Weary of Apple's 
"right brain" ways, Sculley reorganized the company repeatedly, 
each time trying to get back what Apple clearly had lost. He brought 
in a new executive staff to help. But all they were doing was trying 
to manage HOW the company worked when it was the WHY that 
needed attention. Needless to say, morale was dismal. It wasn't until 
Jobs returned in 1997 that everyone inside and outside the company 
was reminded WHY Apple existed. With clarity back, the company 
quickly reestablished its power for innovation, for thinking different 


--- Page 227 ---
START WITH WHY 
220 
and, once again, for redefining industries. With Jobs at the helm 
again, the culture for challenging the status quo, for empowering 
the individual, returned. Every decision was filtered through the 
WHY, and it worked. Like most inspiring leaders, Jobs trusted his 
gut over outside advice. He was regularly criticized for not making 
mass-market decisions, such as letting people clone the Mac. He 
couldn't; those actions violated what he believed. They failed the 
Celery Test. 
When the person who personifies the WHY departs without 
clearly articulating WHY the company was founded in the first 
place, they leave no clear cause for their successor to lead. The new 
CEO will come aboard to run the company and will focus attention 
on the growth of WHAT with little attention to WHY. Worse, they 
may try to implement their own vision without considering the 
cause that originally inspired most people to show up in the first 
place. In these cases, the leader can work against the culture of the 
company instead of leading or building upon it. The result is dimin-
ished morale, mass exodus, poor performance and a slow and 
steady transition to a culture of mistrust and every-man-for-himself. 
It happened at Dell. Michael Dell, too, had a cause when he 
started his company. From the start, he focused on efficiency as a 
way of getting more computing power into more hands. Unfortu-
nately, it was a cause that he too forgot, and then didn't communi-
cate well enough before he stepped down as CEO of Dell Corp. in 
July 2004. After the company started to weaken—customer service, 
for one, plummeted—he came back in less than three years. 
Michael Dell recognized that without him present to keep energy 
focused on the reason Dell Corp. was founded, the company became 
more obsessed with WHAT at the expense of WHY. "The company 
was too focused on the short term, and the balance of priorities was 
way too leaning toward things that deliver short- term results—that 
was the major root cause," Dell told the New York Times in 


--- Page 228 ---
SPLIT HAPPENS 
221 
September 2007. The company had in fact become so dysfunctional 
that some managers were compelled to falsify earnings reports 
between 2003 and 2006 in order to meet sales targets, suggesting a 
corporate culture that put undue pressure on managers to meet 
bottom-line targets. In the meantime, the company had missed 
significant market shifts, most notably the potential of the consumer 
market, and lost its edge with component suppliers as well. And in 
2006, Hewlett-Packard swept past Dell as the largest seller of PCs 
worldwide. Dell had gone through the split and failed to recognize 
the reason it wasn't the company it used to be. 
Starbucks is another good example. In 2000, Howard Schultz 
resigned as CEO of Starbucks, and for the first time in its history 
and despite 50 million customers per week, the company started to 
crack. 
If you look back at the history of Starbucks, it thrived not be-
cause of its coffee but because of the experience it offered to cus-
tomers. It was Schultz who brought that WHY to the company when 
he arrived in 1982, ten years after Gordon Bowker, Jerry Baldwin 
and Zev Siegl first started selling coffee beans in Seattle. In the early 
days it was about the coffee. Schultz, frustrated that the founders of 
Starbucks couldn't see the larger vision, set out to put the company 
on a new course, the course that ultimately turned Starbucks into 
the company we know today. Schultz had been enamored of the 
espresso bars of Italy, and it was his vision of building a comfortable 
environment between work and home, the "third space," as he called 
it, that allowed Starbucks to single-handedly create a coffee-shop 
culture in the United States that had until then only existed on 
college campuses. 
That was the time when Starbucks stood for something. It reflected 
an underlying belief about the world. It was that idea that people 
bought, not the coffee. And it was inspiring. But Starbucks, like so 
many before it, went through the inevitable split. They, too, forgot 


--- Page 229 ---
START WITH WHY 
222 
about WHY the company was founded and started focusing on the 
results and the products. There was a time when Starbucks offered 
the option to sip your coffee out of a ceramic cup and eat your 
Danish off a ceramic plate. Two perfect details that helped bring the 
company's belief to life in the place between work and home. But 
ceramic crockery is expensive to maintain and Starbucks did away 
with it, favoring the more efficient paper cups. Though it saved 
money, it came at a cost: the erosion of trust. Nothing says to a 
customer "We love you, now get out" like a paper cup. It was no 
longer about the third space. It had become about the coffee. 
Starbucks's WHY was going fuzzy. Thankfully, Schultz was there, 
the physical embodiment of the WHY, to remind people of the 
higher cause. But in 2000 he left, and things got worse. 
The company had grown from fewer than 1,000 stores to 13,000 
in only ten years. Eight years and two CEOs later, the company was 
dangerously overextended just as it was facing an onslaught of 
competition from McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts and other un-
expected places. In a now famous memo that Schultz wrote to his 
successor, Jim Donald, just months before returning to take the 
helm, he implored Donald to "make the changes necessary to evoke 
the heritage, the tradition and the passion that we all have for the 
true Starbucks experience." The reason the company was floun-
dering was not that it grew too fast, but that Schultz had not prop-
erly infused his WHY into the organization so that the organization 
could manage the WHY without him. In early 2008, Schultz re-
placed Donald with a leader who could better steer the company 
back to a time before the split: himself. 
None of these executives are considered God's gift to manage-
ment. Steve Jobs's paranoia, for example, is well documented, and 
Bill Gates is socially awkward. Their companies are thousands of 
people deep and they alone can't pull all the strings or push all the 
buttons to make everything work properly. They rely on the brains 


--- Page 230 ---
SPLIT HAPPENS 
223 
and the management skills of teams of people to help them build 
their megaphones. They rely on people who share their cause. In 
this respect, they are no different from other executives. But what 
they all have in common, something that not all CEOs possess, is 
that they physically embody the cause around which they built their 
companies. Their physical presence reminds every executive and 
every employee WHY they show up to work. Put simply: they in-
spire. Yet, like Bill Gates, these inspired leaders have all failed to 
properly articulate their cause in words that others could rally 
around in their absence. Failing to put the movement into hard 
words leaves them as the only ones who can lead the movement. 
What happens when Jobs or Dell or Schultz leave again? 
For companies of any size, success is the greatest challenge. As 
Microsoft grew, Gates stopped talking about what he believed and! 
how he was going to change the world and started talking about 
what the company was doing. Microsoft changed. Founded as a 
company that believed in making people more productive so they 
could achieve their highest potential, Microsoft became a company 
that simply made software products. Such a seemingly subtle 
change affects behaviors. It alters decisions. And it impacts how a 
company structures itself for the future. Though Microsoft had 
changed since its founding, the impact was never as dramatic 
because at least Bill Gates was there, the physical embodiment of the 
cause that inspired his executives and employees. 
Microsoft is just one of the tangible things Gates has done in his 
life to bring his cause to life. The company is one of the WHATs to 
his WHY. And now he's off to do something else that also embodies 
his cause—to use the Gates Foundation to help people around the 
world wake up every day to overcome obstacles so they too can 
have an opportunity achieve their potential. The only difference is 
he's not doing it with software anymore. Steve Ballmer, a smart man 
by all accounts, does not physically embody Gates's vision of the

START WITH WHY 
224 
world. He has the image of a powerful executive who sees numbers, 
competitors and markets. He is a man with a gift for managing the 
WHAT line. Like John Sculley at Apple, Jim Donald at Starbucks 
and Kevin Rollins at Dell—all the CEOs who replaced the visionary 
founders or executives—Ballmer might be the perfect man to work 
alongside a visionary, but is he the perfect man to replace one? 
The entire culture of all these companies was built around one 
man's vision. The only succession plan that will work is to find a 
CEO who believes in and wants to continue to lead that movement, 
not replace it with their own vision of the future. Ballmer knows 
how to rally the company, but can he inspire it? 
Successful succession is more than selecting someone with an 
appropriate skill set—it's about finding someone who is in lockstep 
with the original cause around which the company was founded. 
Great second or third CEOs don't take the helm to implement their 
own vision of the future; they pick up the original banner and lead 
the company into the next generation. That's why we call it succes-
sion, not replacement. There is a continuity of vision. 
One of the reasons Southwest Airlines has been so good at suc-
cession is because its cause is so ingrained in its culture, and the 
CEOs who took over from Herb Kelleher also embodied the cause. 
Howard Putnam was the first president of Southwest after Kelleher. 
Though he was a career airline guy, it was not his resume that made 
him so well suited to lead the company. He was a good fit. Putnam 
recounts the time he met with Kelleher to interview for the job. 
Putnam leaned back in his chair and noticed that Kelleher had 
slipped his shoes off under the desk. More significantly, Putnam 
noticed the hole in one of Kelleher's socks. It was at that point that 
Putnam felt he was the right man for the job. He loved that Kelleher 
was just like everyone else. He too had holes in his socks. 
Although Putnam felt Southwest was right for him, how do we 
know if he was right for Southwest? I had a chance to spend half a 


--- Page 232 ---
SPLIT HAPPENS 
225 
day with Putnam to talk. At one point in the afternoon I suggested 
we take a break and grab a Starbucks. The mere suggestion in-
censed him. "I'm not going to Starbucks!" he cracked. "I'm not 
paying five dollars for a cup of coffee. And what the heck is a 
Frappuccino anyway?" It was at that point I realized how perfect a 
fit Putnam was for Southwest. He was an everyman. A Dunkin' 
Donuts guy. He was a perfect man to take the torch from Kelleher 
and charge forward. Southwest inspired him. In the case of Howard 
Putnam, Kelleher hired somebody who could represent the cause, 
not reinvent it. 
Today it has become so acculturated there that it's almost automatic. 
The same could be said for Colleen Barrett, who became president 
of Southwest in 2001, some thirty years after she was working as 
Kelleher's secretary in his San Antonio law firm. By 2001, the 
company had nearly 30,000 employees and a fleet of 344 planes. By 
the time she took over, Barrett says that running the company had 
become "a very collective effort." Kelleher stopped his day-to-day 
involvement in the company, but left a corporate culture so strong 
that his presence in the hallways was no longer needed. The 
physical person had largely been replaced by the folklore of 
Kelleher. But it is the folklore that has helped keep the WHY alive. 
Barrett freely admits she's not the smartest executive out there. She 
is self-deprecating in her personal assessment, in fact. But as the 
leader of the company, being the smartest was not her job. Her job 
was to lead the cause. To personify the values and remind everyone 
WHY they are there. 
The good news is, it will be easy to know if a successor is carry-
ing the right torch. Simply apply the Celery Test and see if what the 
company is saying and doing makes sense. Test whether WHAT 
they are doing effectively proves WHY they were founded. If we 
can't easily assess a company's WHY simply from looking at their 


--- Page 233 ---
START WITH WHY 
226 
products, services, marketing and public statements, then odds are 
high that they don't know what it is either. If they did, so would we. 
When the WHY Goes, WHAT Is All You'll Have Left 
On April 5,1992, at approximately eight in the morning, Wal-Mart 
lost its WHY. On that day, Sam Walton, Wal-Mart's inspired leader, 
the man who embodied the cause around which he built the world's 
largest retailer, died in the University of Arkansas Medical Science 
Hospital in Little Rock of bone marrow cancer. Soon after, Walton's 
oldest son, S. Robeson Walton, who succeeded his father as chair-
man of the company, gave a public statement. "No changes are ex-
pected in the corporate direction, control or policy," he said. Sadly 
for Wal-Mart employees, customers and shareholders, that is not 
what happened. 
Sam Walton was the embodiment of the everyman. Though he 
was named the richest man in America by Forbes magazine in 1985, 
a title he held until he died, he never understood the importance 
others placed on money. Certainly, Walton was a competitor, and 
money was a good yardstick of success. But that's not what gave 
Walton or those who worked at Wal-Mart the feeling of success. It 
was people Walton valued above all else. People. 
Look after people and people will look after you was his belief, 
and everything Walton and Wal-Mart did proved it. In the early 
days, for example, Walton insisted on showing up for work on Sat-
urdays out of fairness to his store employees who had to work 
weekends. He remembered birthdays and anniversaries and even 
that a cashier's mother had just undergone gallbladder surgery. He 
chastised his executives for driving expensive cars and resisted 
using a corporate jet for many years. If the average American didn't 
have those things, then neither should those who are supposed to 
be their champions. 


--- Page 234 ---
SPLIT HAPPENS 
227 
Wal-Mart never went through a split under Walton's command, 
because Walton never forgot where he came from. "I still can't be-
lieve it was news that I get my hair cut at the barbershop. Where 
else would I get it cut?" he said. "Why do I drive a pickup truck? 
What am I supposed to haul my dogs around in, a Rolls-Royce?" 
Often seen wearing his signature tweed jacket and a trucker's cap, 
Walton was the embodiment of those he aimed to serve—the 
average-Joe American. 
With a company so beloved by employees, customers and com-
munities, Walton made only one major blunder. He didn't put his 
cause into clear enough words so that others could continue to lead 
the cause after he died. It's not entirely his fault. The part of the 
brain that controls the WHY doesn't control language. So, like so 
many, the best Walton could articulate was HOW to bring his cause 
to life. He talked about making products cheap to make things more 
affordable to the average working American. He talked about 
building stores in rural communities so that the backbone of Amer-
ica's workforce didn't have to travel to the urban centers. It all made 
sense. All his decisions passed the Celery Test. It was the WHY 
upon which the company was built, however, that was left unsaid. 
Walton was involved in the company until just before his death, 
when his ailing health prevented him from participating any longer. 
Like all organizations with founder-leaders whose physical presence 
helps keep the WHY alive, his continued involvement i|j the 
company had reminded everyone WHY they came to work every 
day. He inspired everyone around him. Just as Apple ran oij the 
fumes of Steve Jobs for a few years after he left the company before 
significant cracks started to show, so did Wal-Mart remember Sam 
Walton and his WHY for a short time after he died. But as the WHY 
started to get fuzzier and fuzzier, the company changed direction. 
From then on, there would be a new motivation at th<! company, 


--- Page 235 ---
START WITH WHY 
228 
and it was something that Walton himself cautioned against: 
chasing money. 
Costco was cofounded in 1983 by WHY-type Jim Sinegal and 
HOW-type Jeffrey Brotman. Sinegal learned about discount retailing 
from Sol Price, the same person from whom Sam Walton admitted 
to "borrowing" much of what he knew about the business. And, like 
Walton, Sinegal believes in people first. "We're going to be a 
company that's on a first-name basis with everyone," he said in an 
interview on ABC's newsmagazine show 20/20. Following the same 
formula as other inspiring leaders, Costco believes in looking after 
its employees first. Historically, they have paid their people about 
40 percent more than those who work at Sam's Club, the Wal-Mart-
owned discount warehouse. And Costco offers above-average 
benefits, including health coverage for more than 90 percent of their 
employees. As a result, their turnover is consistently five times 
lower than Sam's Club. 
Like all companies built around a cause, Costco has relied on 
their megaphone to help them grow. They don't have a PR depart-
ment and they don't spend money on advertising. The Law of Dif-
fusion is all that Costco needed to get the word out. "Imagine that 
you have 120,000 loyal ambassadors out there who are constantly 
saying good things about you," quips Sinegal, recognizing the value 
of trust and loyalty of his employees over advertising and PR. 
For years, Wall Street analysts criticized Costco's strategy of 
spending so much on their people instead of on cutting costs to 
boost margins and help share value. Wall Street would preferred the 
company to focus on WHAT they did at the expense of WHY they 
did it. A Deutsche Bank analyst told FORTUNE magazine, "Costco 
continues to be a company that is better at serving the club member 
and employee than the shareholder." 
Fortunately, Sinegal trusts his gut more than he trusts Wall Street 
analysts. "Wall Street is in the business of making money between

229 
now and next Tuesday," he said in the 20/20 interview. "We're in the 
business of building an organization, an institution that we hope 
will be here fifty years from now. And paying good wages and 
keeping people working with you is very good business." 
The amazing insight in all of this is not just how inspiring Sinegal 
is, but that almost everything he says and does echoes Sam Walton. 
Wal-Mart got as big as it did doing the exact same thing— focusing 
on WHY and ensuring that WHAT they did proved it. Money is 
never a cause, it is always a result. But on that fateful day in April 
1992, Wal-Mart stopped believing in their WHY. 
Since Sam Walton's death, Wal-Mart has been battered by scan-
dals of mistreating employees and customers all in the name of 
shareholder value. Their WHY has gone so fuzzy that even when 
they do things well, few are willing to give them credit. The com-
pany, for example, was among the first major corporations to de-
velop an environmental policy aimed at reducing waste and 
encouraging recycling. But Wal-Mart's critics have grown so skepti-
cal of the company's motives that the move was largely dismissed as 
posturing. "Wal-Mart has been working to improve its image and 
lighten its environmental impact for several years now," a column 
published on the New York Times Web site on October 28, 2008, read. 
"Wal-Mart is still selling consumerism even as it pledges to cut the 
social and environmental costs of making the stuff in its stores." 
Costco, on the other hand, was later than Wal-Mart to announce an 
environmental policy, yet has received a disproportionate amount 
of attention. The difference is that people believe it when Costco does 
it. When people know WHY you do WHAT you do, they are willing 
to give you credit for everything that could serve as proof of WHY. 
When they are unclear about your WHY, WHAT you do has no 
context. Even though the things you do or decisions you make may 
be good, they won't make sense to others without a clear un-
derstanding of WHY. 


--- Page 237 ---
START WITH WHY 
230 
And what of the results? Still running on the memory of Sam 
Walton, Wal-Mart's culture stayed intact at first, and the value of the 
two stocks was about even for a few years after Walton died. But as 
Wal-Mart continued to run its business in a post-Sam, post-split 
manner while Costco maintained clarity of WHY, the difference in 
value changed dramatically. An investment in Wal-Mart on the day 
Sam Walton died would have earned a shareholder a 300 percent 
gain by the time this book was written. An investment made in 
Costco on the same day would have netted an 800 percent gain. 
Costco's advantage is that the embodiment of their WHY, Jim 
Sinegal, is still there. The things he says and does help reinforce to 
all those around him what the company stands for. Staying true to 
that WHY, Sinegal draws a $430,000 salary, a relatively small 
amount given the size and success of the company. At Wal-Mart's 
peak, Sam Walton never took a salary of more than $350,000 per 
year, also consistent with what he believed. David Glass, the first 
man to take over as CEO after Sam Walton, a man who had spent 
considerable time around Walton, said, "A lot of what goes on these 
days with high-flying companies and these overpaid CEOs, who're 
really just looting from the top and aren't watching out for anybody 
but themselves, really upsets me. It's one of the main things wrong 
with American business today." 
Three more CEOs have attempted to carry the torch that Walton 
lit. And with each succession that torch, that clear sense of purpose, 
cause and belief, has grown dimmer and dimmer. The new hope lies 
in Michael T. Duke, who took over as CEO in early 2009. Duke's 
goal is to restore the luster and the clarity of Wal-Mart's WHY. 
And to do it, he started by paying himself an annual salary of 
$5.43 million.

THE ORIGINS OF A WHY 
It started in Vietnam War-era Northern California, where 
antigovernment ideals and distain for large centers of power ran 
rampant. Two young men saw the power of government and 
corporations as the enemy, not because they were big, per se, but 
because they squashed the spirit of the individual. They imagined a 
world in which an individual had a voice. They imagined a time 
when an individual could successfully stand up to incumbent 
power, old assumptions and status-quo thoughts and successfully 
challenge them. Even redirect them. They hung out with hippie 
types who shared their beliefs, but they saw a different way to 
change the world that didn't require protesting or engaging in 
anything illegal. 
Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs came of age in this time. Not only 
was the revolutionary spirit running high in Northern California, 
but it was also the time and place of the computer revolution. And 
in this technology they saw the opportunity to start their own rev-
olution. "The Apple gave an individual the power to do the same 
things as any company," Wozniak recounts. "For the first time ever, 
one person could take on a corporation simply because they had the 
ability to use the technology." Wozniak engineered the Apple I and

234 
later the Apple II to be simple enough for people to harness the 
power of the technology. Jobs knew how to sell it. Thus was born 
Apple Computer. A company with a purpose—to give the 
individual to power to stand up to established power. To empower 
the dreamers and the idealists to challenge the status quo and 
succeed. But their cause, their WHY, started long before Apple was 
born. 
In 1971, working out of Wozniak's dorm room at UC Berkeley 
the two Steves made something they called the Blue Box. Their little 
device hacked the phone system to give people the ability to; avoid 
paying long-distance rates on their phone bills. Apple computers 
didn't exist yet, but Jobs and Woz were already challenging a Big 
Brother-type power, in this case Ma Bell, American Telephony and 
Telegraph, the monopoly phone company. Technically, what the 
Blue Box did was illegal, and with no desire to challenge power; by 
breaking the law, Jobs and Woz never actually used the device 
themselves. But they liked the idea of giving other individuals the 
ability to avoid having to play by the rules of monopolistic forced a 
theme that would repeat many more times in Apple's future. ' 
On April 1, 1976, they repeated their pattern again. They took on 
the giants of the computer industry, most notably Big Blue IBM. 
Before the Apple, computing still meant using a punch card to give 
instructions to a huge mainframe squirreled away in a computer 
center somewhere. IBM targeted their technology to corporations 
and not, as Apple intended, as a tool for individuals to target, 
corporations. With clarity of purpose and amazing discipline, 
Apple Computer's success seemed to follow the Law of Diffusion 
almost by design. In its first year in business, the company sold $1 
million worth of computers to those who believed what they 
believed. By year two, they had sold $10 million worth. By their 
third year in business they were a $100 million company, and they 
attained billion-dollar status within only six years.

THE ORIGINS OF A WHY

Already a household name, in 1984 Apple launched the Macintosh 
with their famed "1984" commercial that aired during the Super 
Bowl. Directed by Ridley Scott, famed director of cult classics like 
Blade Runner, the commercial also changed the course of the 
advertising industry. The first "Super Bowl commercial," it ushered 
in the annual tradition of big-budget, cinematic Super Bowl 
advertising. With the Macintosh, Apple once again changed the 
tradition of how things were done. They challenged the standard of 
Microsoft's DOS, the standard operating system used by most 
personal computers at the time. The Macintosh was the first mass-
market computer to use a graphical user interface and a mouse, 
allowing people to simply "point and click" rather than input code. 
Ironically, it was Microsoft that took Apple's concept to the masses 
with Windows, Gates's version of the graphical user interface. 
Apple's ability to ignite revolutions and Microsoft's ability to take 
ideas to the mass market perfectly illustrate the WHY of each 
company and indeed their respective founders. Jobs has always 
been about challenge and Gates has always been about getting to 
the most people. 
Apple would continue to challenge with other products that 
followed the same pattern. Recent examples include the iPod and, 
more significantly, iTunes. With these technologies, Apple chal-
lenged the status-quo business model of the music industry—an 
industry so distracted trying to protect its intellectual property and 
their outdated business model that it was busy suing thirteen- year-
old music pirates while Apple redefined the online music market. 
The pattern repeated again when Apple introduced the iPhone. The 
status quo dictated that the cellular providers and not the phone 
manufacturer decide the features and capabilities of the actual 
phones. T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, and Sprint, for example, tell 
Motorola, LG, and Nokia what to do. Apple changed all that when 
they announced that, with the iPhone, they would be telling the 


--- Page 243 ---
START WITH WHY 
236 
provider what the phone would do. Ironically the company that 
Apple challenged with their Blue Box decades before, this time 
around exhibited classic early-adopter behavior. AT&T was the 
only one to agree to this new model, and so another revolution was 
ignited. 
Apple's keen aptitude for innovation is born out of its WHY and, 
save for the years Jobs was missing, it has never changed since the 
company was founded. Industries holding on to legacy business 
models should be forewarned; you could be next. If Apple stays true 
to their WHY, the television and movie industries will likely be next. 
Apple's ability to do what they do has nothing to do with indus-
try expertise. All computer and technology companies have open 
access to talent and resources and are just as qualified to produce all 
the products Apple does. It has to do with a purpose, cause or belief 
that started many years ago with a couple of idealists in Cupertino, 
California. "I want to put a ding in the universe," as Steve Jobs put it. 
And that's exactly what Apple does in the industries in which it 
competes. Apple is born out of its founders' WHY. There is no 
difference between one or the other. Apple is just one of the WHATs 
to Jobs's and Woz's WHY. The personalities of Jobs and Apple are 
exactly the same. In fact, the personalities of all those who are 
viscerally drawn to Apple are similar. There is no difference 
between an Apple customer and an Apple employee. One believes 
in Apple's WHY and chooses to work for the company, and the 
other believes in Apple's WHY and chooses to buy its products. It is 
just a behavioral difference. Loyal shareholders are no different 
either. WHAT they buy is different, but the reason they buy and 
remain loyal is the same. The products of the company become 
symbols of their own identities. The die-hards outside the company 
are said to be a part of the cult of Apple. The die-hards inside the 
company are said to be a part of the "cult of Steve." Their symbols 
are different, but their devotion to the cause is the same. That we 


--- Page 244 ---
THE ORIGINS OF A WHY 
237 
use the word "cult" implies that we can recognize that there is a , 
deep faith, something irrational, that all those who believe share* 
And we'd be right. Jobs, his company, his loyal employees and his 
loyal customers all exist to push the boundaries. They all fancy a 
good revolution. 
 
Just because Apple's WHY is so clear does not mean everyone is, 
drawn to it. Some people like them and some don't. Some people 
embrace them and some are repelled by them. But it cannot be 
denied: they stand for something. The Law of Diffusion says that 
only 2.5 percent of the population has an innovator mentality— they 
are a group of people willing to trust their intuition and take greater 
risks than others. Perhaps it is no coincidence that Microsoft 
Windows sits on 96 percent of the world's computers whereas 
Apple maintains about 2.5 percent. Most people don't want to 
challenge the status quo. 
Though Apple employees will tell you the company's success lies 
in its products, the fact is that a lot of companies make quality 
products. And though Apple's employees may still insist that their 
products are better, it depends on the standard by which you are 
judging them. Apple's products are indeed best for those who relate 
to Apple's WHY. It is Apple's belief that comes through in all they 
think, say and do that makes them who they are. They are so 
effective at it, they are able to clearly identify their own products 
simply by preceding the product name with the letter "i." But they 
don't just own the letter, they own the word "I." They are a company 
that champions the creative spirit of the individual, and their prod-
ucts, services and marketing simply prove it.

The WHY Comes from Looking Back 
Conservative estimates put the numbers at three to one. But some 
historians have said the English army was outnumbered by six to 
one. Regardless of which estimates you choose to believe, the pros-
pects for Henry V, king of England, did not look good. It was late 
October in the year 1415 and the English army stood ready to do 
battle against a much bigger French force at Agincourt in northern 
France. But the numbers were just one of Henry's problems. 
The English army had marched over 250 miles, taking them 
nearly three weeks, and had lost nearly 40 percent of their original 
numbers to sickness. The French, in stark contrast, were better rested 
and in much better spirits. The better-trained and more experienced 
French were also excited at the prospect of exacting their revenge on 
the English to make up for the humiliation of previous defeats. And 
to top it all off, the French were vastly better equipped; The English 
were lightly armored, but whatever protection they did have was no 
match for the superior weight of the French armor, But anyone who 
knows their medieval European history already knows the outcome 
of the battle of Agincourt. Despite the overwhelming odds, the 
English won. 
The English had one vital piece of technology that was able to 
confound the French and start a chain of events that would ulti-
mately result in a French defeat. The English had the longbow, a 
weapon with astounding range for its time. Standing far from the 
battlefield, far enough away that heavy armor was not needed; the 
English could look down into the valley and shower the French with 
arrows. But technology and range aren't what give an arrow its 
power. By itself, an arrow is a flimsy stick of wood with a sharpened 
tip and some feathers. By itself, an arrow cannot stand up to a sword 
or penetrate armor. What gives an arrow the ability to take on 
experience, training, numbers and armor is momentum. That flimsy 
stick of wood, when hurtling through the air, becomes a force only 


--- Page 246 ---
THE ORIGINS OF A WHY 
239 
when it is moving fast in one direction. But what does the battle of 
Agincourt have to do with finding your WHY? 
Before it can gain any power or achieve any impact, an arrow 
must be pulled backward, 180 degrees away from the target. And 
that's also where a WHY derives its power. The WHY does not come 
from looking ahead at what you want to achieve and figuring out an 
appropriate strategy to get there. It is not born out of any! market 
research. It does not come from extensive interviews with customers 
or even employees. It comes from looking in the completely 
opposite direction from where you are now. Finding WHY is a 
process of discovery, not invention. 
Just as Apple's WHY developed during the rebellious 1960s and 
'70s, the WHY for every other individual or organization comes 
from the past. It is born out of the upbringing and life experience of 
an individual or small group. Every single person has a WHY and 
every single organization has one too. An organization, don't forget, 
is one of the WHATs, one of the tangible things a founder or group 
of founders has done in their lives to prove their WHY. 
Every company, organization or group with the ability to inspire 
starts with a person or small group of people who were inspired to 
do something bigger than themselves. Gaining clarity of WHY, 
ironically, is not the hard part. It is the discipline to trust one's gut, 
to stay true to one's purpose, cause or beliefs. Remaining completely 
in balance and authentic is the most difficult part. The few that are 
able to build a megaphone, and not just a company, around their 
cause are the ones who earn the ability to inspire. In doing so, they 
harness a power to move people that few can even imagine. 
Learning the WHY of a company or an organization or 
understanding the WHY of any social movement always starts with 
one thing: you.

I Am a Failure 
There are three months indelibly printed in my memory— 
September to December 2005. This was when I hit rock bottom. 
I started my business in February 2002 and it was incredibly 
exciting. I was "full of piss and vinegar," as my grandfather would 
say. From an early age, my goal was to start my own business. It 
was the American Dream, and I was living it. My whole feeling of 
self- worth came from the fact that I did it, I took the plunge, and it 
felt amazing. If anyone ever asked me what I did, I would pose like 
George Reeves from the old Superman TV series. I would put my 
hands on my hips, stick out my chest, stand at an angle and with 
my head raised high I'd declare, "I am an entrepreneur." What I did 
was how I defined myself, and it felt good. I wasn't like Superman, I 
was Superman. 
As anyone who starts a business knows, it is a fantastic race. There 
is a statistic that hangs over your head—over 90 percent of all new 
businesses fail in the first three years. For anyone with even a bit of 
a competitive spirit in them, especially for someone who defines 
himself or herself as an entrepreneur (hands on hips, chest out, 
standing at a slight angle), these overwhelming odds of failure are 
not intimidating, they only add fuel to the fire. The foolishness of 
thinking that you're a part of the small minority of those who 
actually will make it past three years and defy the odds is part of 
what makes entrepreneurs who they are, driven by passion and 
completely irrational. 
After year one, we celebrated. We hadn't gone out of business. 
We were beating the odds. We were living the dream. Two years 
passed. Then three years. I'm still not sure how we did it—we never 
properly implemented any good systems and processes. But to heck 
with it, we'd beaten the odds. I had achieved my goal and that's all 
that mattered. I was now a proud member of a very small group of 


--- Page 248 ---
THE ORIGINS OF A WHY 
241 
people who could say, with statistical proof, that I was an American 
small business owner. 
The fourth year would prove to be very different. The novelty of 
being an entrepreneur had worn off. I no longer stood like George 
Reeves. When asked what I did, I would now tell people that I did 
"positioning and strategy consulting." It was much less exciting and 
it certainly didn't feel like a big race anymore. It was no longer a 
passionate pursuit, it was just a business. And the reality was that 
the business did not look that rosy. 
We were never a runaway success. We made a living, but not 
much more. We had some FORTUNE 500 clients and we did good 
work. I was crystal clear on what we did. And I could tell you how 
we were different—how we did it. Like everyone else in the game, I 
would try to convince prospective clients how we did it, how we 
were better, how our way was unique ... and it was hard work. The 
truth is, we beat the odds because of my energy, not because of my 
business acumen, but I didn't have the energy to sustain that 
strategy for the rest of my life. I was aware enough to know that we 
needed better systems and processes if the business was to sustain 
itself. 
I was incredibly demoralized. Intellectually, I could tell you what 
I needed to do, I just couldn't do it. By September 2005 I was the 
closest I've ever been to, if I wasn't already, completely depressed. 
My whole life I'd been a pretty happy-go-lucky guy, so just being 
unhappy was bad enough. But this was worse. 
The depression made me paranoid. I was convinced I was going 
to go out of business. I was convinced I was going to be evicted 
from my apartment. I was certain anyone who worked for me didn't 
like me and that my clients knew I was a fraud. I thought everyone I 
met was smarter than me. I thought everyone I met was better than 
me. Any energy I had left to sustain the business now went into 
propping myself up and pretending that I was doing well.

START WITH WHY 
242 
If things were to change, I knew I needed to learn to implement 
more structure before everything crashed. I attended conferences, 
read books and asked successful friends for advice on how to do it. 
It was all good advice, but I couldn't hear it. No matter what I was 
told, all I could hear was that I was doing everything wrong. Trying 
to fix the problem didn't make me feel better, it made me feel worse. 
I felt more helpless. I started having desperate thoughts, thoughts 
that for an entrepreneur are almost worse than suicide: I thought 
about getting a job. Anything. Anything that would stop the feeling 
of falling I had almost every day. 
I remember visiting the family of my future brother-in-law for 
Thanksgiving that year. I sat on the couch in the living room of his 
mother's house, people were talking to me, but I never heard a 
word. If I was asked questions, I replied only in platitudes. I didn't 
really desire or even have the ability to make conversation anymore. 
It was then that I realized the truth. Statistics notwithstanding, I was 
a failure. 
As an anthropology major in college and a strategy guy in the 
marketing and advertising world, I had always been curious about 
why people do the things they do. Earlier in my career I started 
becoming curious about these same themes in the real world—in 
my case, corporate marketing. There is an old saying in the industry 
that 50 percent of all marketing works, the problem is, which 50 
percent? I was always astounded that so many companies would 
operate with such a level of uncertainty. Why would anyone want 
to leave the success of something that costs so much, with so much 
at stake to the flip of a coin? I was convinced that if some marketing 
worked, it was possible to figure out why. 
All companies of equal resources have equal access to the same 
agencies, the same talent, and the same media, so why does some 
marketing work and some doesn't? Working in an ad agency I'd 
seen it all the time. With conditions relatively equal, the same team 


--- Page 250 ---
THE ORIGINS OF A WHY 
243 
could develop a campaign that would be hugely successful one 
year, then develop something the next year that would do nothing. 
Instead of focusing on the stuff that didn't work, I chose to focus on 
the stuff that worked to find out what it all had in common. The 
good news for me was there was not much to study. 
How has Apple been able to so consistently outmarket their 
competition over and over and over? What did Harley-Davidson do 
so well that they were able to create a following of people so loyal 
that they would tattoo a corporate logo on their bodies? Why did 
people love Southwest Airlines so much—they aren't really that 
special... are they? In an attempt to codify why these worked, I 
developed a simple concept I called The Golden Circle. But my little 
theory sat buried in my computer files. It was a little pet project 
With no real application, just something I found interesting. 
It would be months later that I met a woman at an event who 
took an interest in my perspectives in marketing. Victoria Duffy 
Hopper grew up in an academic family and also has a lifelong 
fascination with human behavior. She was the first to tell me about 
the limbic brain and the neocortex. My curiosity piqued by what she 
was telling me, I started reading about the biology of the brain, and 
it was then that I made the real discovery. 
The biology of human behavior and The Golden Circle overlapped 
perfectly. While I was trying to understand why some marketing 
worked and some didn't, I had tripped over something vastly more 
profound. I discovered why people do what they do. It was then 
that I realized what was the real cause of my stress. The problem 
wasn't that I didn't know what to do or how to do it, the problem 
was I had forgotten WHY. I had gone through what I now know is a 
split, and I needed to rediscover my WHY.

To Inspire People to Do the Things That Inspire Them 
Henry Ford said, "If you think you can or you think you can't, 
you're right." He was a brilliant WHY-guy who changed the way 
industry works. A man who embodied all the characteristics of a 
great leader, who understood the importance of perspective. I 
wasn't any dumber than I was when I started my business, probably 
the opposite, in fact. What I had lost was perspective. I knew what I 
was doing, but I had forgotten WHY. There is a difference between 
running with all your heart with your eyes closed and running with 
your all your heart with your eyes wide open. For three years, my 
heart had pounded but my eyes had been closed. I had passion and 
energy, but I lacked focus and direction. I needed to remember what 
inspired my passion. 
I became obsessed with the concept of WHY. I was consumed by 
the idea of it. It was all I talked about. When I looked back to my 
upbringing, I discovered a remarkable theme. Whether among 
friends, at school or professionally, I was always the eternal opti-
mist. I was the one who inspired everyone to believe they could do 
whatever they wanted. This pattern is my WHY. To inspire. It didn't 
matter if I was doing it in marketing or consulting. It didn't matter 
what types of companies I worked with or in which industries I 
worked. To inspire people to do the things that inspired them, so 
that, together, we can change the world. That's the path to which 
my life and my work is now completely devoted. Henry Ford 
would have been proud of me. After months of thinking I couldn't, 
now I knew I could. 
I made myself a guinea pig for the concept. If the reason I hit 
rock bottom was because my Golden Circle was out of balance, then 
I needed to get it back in balance. If it was important to start with 
WHY, then I would start with WHY in everything I did. There is not 
a single concept in this book that I don't practice. I stand at the 
mouth of my megaphone and I talk about the WHY to anyone who 


--- Page 252 ---
THE ORIGINS OF A WHY 
245 
will listen. Those early adopters who hear my cause see me as a tool 
in their arsenal to achieve their own WHY. And they introduced me 
to others whom they believed I could inspire. And so the Law of 
Diffusion started to do its job. 
Though The Golden Circle and the concept of WHY was working 
for me, I wanted to show it to others. I had a decision to make: do I 
try to patent it, protect it and use it to make lots of money, or do I 
give it away? This decision was to be my first Celery Test. My WHY 
is to inspire people to do the things that inspire them, and if I am to 
be authentic to that cause there was only one decision to make—to 
give it away, to talk about it, to share it. There would never be any 
secret sauce or special formula for which only I knew the 
ingredients. The vision is to have every person and every orga-
nization know their WHY and use it to benefit all they do. So that's 
what I'm doing, and I'm relying entirely on the concept of WHY and 
the naturally occurring pattern that is The Golden Circle to help me 
get there. 
The experiment started to work. Prior to starting with WHY, I 
had been invited to give one public speech in my life. Now I get 
between thirty and forty invitations per year, from all sorts of audi-
ences, all over the world, to speak about The Golden Circle. I speak 
to audiences of entrepreneurs, large corporations, nonprofits, in 
politics and government. I've spoken at the Pentagon to the chief of 
staff and the secretary of the Air Force. Prior to The Golden Circle, I 
didn't even know anyone in the military. Prior to starting with 
WHY, I had never been on television; in fewer than two years I 
started getting regular invitations to appear on MSNBC. I've worked 
with members of Congress, having never done any government or 
political work prior to starting with WHY. 
I am the same person. I know the same things I did before. The 
only difference is, now I start with WHY. Like Gordon Bethune who 
turned around Continental with the same people and the same 


--- Page 253 ---
START WITH WHY 
246 
equipment, I was able to turn things around with the things I al-
ready knew and did. 
I'm not better connected than everyone else. I don't have a better 
work ethic. I don't have an Ivy League education and my grades in 
college were average. The funniest part is, I still don't know how to 
build a business. The only thing that I do that most people don't is I 
learned how to start with WHY.

THE NEW COMPETITION 
If You Follow Your WHY, Then Others Will Follow You 
"BANG!" The gun fires and the race is on. The runners take off 
across the field. It rained the day before and the ground is still 
damp. The temperature is cool. It is a perfect day for running. The, 
line of runners quickly forms a pack. Like a school of fish they come 
together as one. They move as one. The pack sets a pace to 
maximize their energy for the whole race. As with any race, in a  
short period of time the stronger ones will start to pull ahead and 
the weaker ones will start to fall behind. But not Ben Comen. Ben 
was left behind as soon as the starter gun sounded. Ben's not the 
fastest runner on the team. In fact, he's the slowest. He has never 
won a single race the entire time he's been on the Hanna High 
School cross-country track team. Ben, you see, has cerebral palsy. 
Cerebral palsy, a condition often caused by complications at. 
birth, affects someone's movement and balance. The physical prob-
lems endure for a lifetime. Misshapen spines create a twisted pos-
ture. Muscles are often withered and motor reflexes slow. Tightness 
in the muscles and joints also affect balance. Those with CP often

248 
have an unsteady gait, their knees knock and their feet drag. To an 
outsider, they may seem clumsy. Or even broken. 
The pack pulls farther and farther ahead while Ben falls farther 
and farther behind. He slips on the wet grass and falls forward into 
the soft earth. He slowly picks himself up and keeps going. Down 
he goes again. This time it hurts. He gets back up and keeps run-
ning. Ben won't quit. The pack is now out of sight and Ben is 
running alone. It is quiet. He can hear his own labored breathing. 
He feels lonely. He trips over his own feet again, and down he goes 
yet another time. No matter his mental strength, there is no hiding 
the pain and frustration on his face. He grimaces as he uses all his 
energy to pull himself back to his feet to continue running. For Ben, 
this is part of the routine. Everyone else finishes the race in about 
twenty-five minutes. It usually takes Ben more than forty- five 
minutes. 
When Ben eventually crosses the finish line he is in pain and he 
is exhausted. It took every ounce of strength he had to make it. His 
body is bruised and bloodied. He is covered in mud. Ben inspires 
us, indeed. But this is not a story of "when the going gets tough, the 
tough get going." This is not a story of "when you fall down, pick 
yourself up." Those are great lessons to learn, without a doubt, but 
we don't need Ben Comen to teach us those lessons. There are 
dozens of others we can look to for that, like an Olympic athlete, for 
example, who suffered an injury just months before the games only 
to come back to win a medal. Ben's lesson is deeper. 
Something amazing happens after about twenty-five minutes. 
When everybody else is done with their race, everyone comes back 
to run with Ben. Ben is the only runner who, when he falls, someone 
else will help pick him up. Ben is the only runner who, when he 
finishes, has a hundred people running behind him. 
What Ben teaches us is special. When you compete against everyone 
else, no one wants to help you. But when you compete against 


--- Page 256 ---
THE NEW COMPETITION 
249 
yourself, everyone wants to help you. Olympic athletes don't help 
each other. They're competitors. Ben starts every race with a very 
clear sense of WHY he's running. He's not there to beat anyone but 
himself. Ben never loses sight of that. His sense of WHY he's 
running gives him the strength to keep going. To keep pushing. To 
keep getting up. To keep going. And to do it again and again and 
again. And every day he runs, the only time Ben sets out to beat is 
his own. 
Now think about how we do business. We're always competing 
against someone else. We're always trying to be better than someone 
else. Better quality. More features. Better service. We're always 
comparing ourselves to others. And no one wants to help us. What 
if we showed up to work every day simply to be better than our-
selves? What if the goal was to do better work this week than we 
did the week before? To make this month better than last month? 
For no other reason than because we want to leave the organization 
in a better state than we found it? 
All organizations start with WHY, but only the great ones keep 
their WHY clear year after year. Those who forget WHY they were 
founded show up to the race every day to outdo someone else in-
stead of to outdo themselves. The pursuit, for those who lose sight 
of WHY they are running the race, is for the medal or to beat some-
one else. 
What if the next time when someone asks, "Who's your com-
petition?" we replied, "No idea." What if the next time someone 
pushes, "Well, what makes you better than your competition?" we 
replied, "We're not better than them in all cases." And what if the 
next time someone asks, "Well why should I do business with you 
then?" we answer with confidence, "Because the work we're doing 
now is better than the work we were doing six months ago. And the 
work we'll be doing six months from now will be better than the 
work we're doing today. Because we wake up every day with a

START WITH WHY

sense of WHY we come to work. We come to work to inspire people 
to do the things that inspire them. Are we better than our 
competition? If you believe what we believe and you believe that 
the things we do can help you, then we're better. If you don't believe 
what we believe and you don't believe the things we can do will 
help you, then we're not better. Our goal is to find customers who 
believe what we believe and work together so that we can all 
succeed. We're looking for people to stand shoulder-to-shoulder 
with us in pursuit of the same goal. We're not interested in sitting 
across a table from each other in pursuit of a sweeter deal. And here 
are the things we're doing to advance our cause ..." And then the 
details of HOW and WHAT you do follow. But this time, it started 
with WHY. 
Imagine if every organization started with WHY. Decisions 
would be simpler. Loyalties would be greater. Trust would be a 
common currency. If our leaders were diligent about starting with 
WHY, optimism would reign and innovation would thrive. As this 
book illustrates, there is precedence for this standard. No matter the 
size of the organization, no matter the industry, no matter the 
product or the service, if we all take some responsibility to start with 
WHY and inspire others to do the same, then, together, we can 
change the world. 
And that's pretty inspiring.

inspire.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
There is nothing that brings me more joy and happiness in this 
world than waking up every day with a clear sense of WHY—to 
inspire people to do the things that inspire them. It is a simple thing 
to do when surrounded by so many amazing people to inspire me. 
There are countless people who believed in me and helped me 
over the years. I'd like to thank those who helped me build a piece 
of my megaphone with this book. Amy Hertz was the first to insist 
that I write it and introduced me to my incredible agent, Richard 
Pine. Richard believes in doing good things in the world and has 
made it his business to make authors out of those who have a pos-
itive message to share. His patience and counsel have been invalu-
able. To Russ Edelman who was such a nice guy to introduce me to 
his editor, Jeffrey Krames, who, in turn, took a bet on me and let me 
push him to do things differently. To Adrian Zackheim, who 
willingly challenges convention and is leading the evolution of the 
publishing industry. 
Thank you to Mark Rubin, who sees the colors I can see and in 
whose basement I started writing, to Tom and Alicia Rypma, in 
whose home I continued writing, and to Delta Airlines, for being so 
good to me while I wrote so much at 35,000 feet. To Julia Hurley, 
who made sure everything was right. To the whole team at Portfo-
lio, who worked so hard to bring this book to life. And, most im-

portantly, to Laurie Flynn, who so passionately devoted herself (and 
her family) to help me tell this story. 
I have had the great honor and privilege of meeting some 
wonderful people who have inspired me in a way that is hard to 
quantify. Ron Bruder has changed the way I see the world. Brig. 
Gen. Lori Robinson has shown me what the humility of great lead-
ership looks like. Kim Harrison, who lives her WHY—to appreciate 
all good things around her—and works tirelessly to see to it that 
good ideas and people are appreciated. She taught me what a true 
partnership looks and feels like. And to those whose shared what 
they know to help bring the WHY to life, I am truly grateful for 
your time and energy: Colleen Barrett, Gordon Bethune, Ben 
Comen, Randy Fowler, Christina Harbridge, Dwayne Honor6, 
Howard Jeruchimowitz, Guy Kawasaki, Howard Putnam, James 
Tobin, Acacia Salatti, Jeff Sumpter, Col. "Cruiser" Wilsbach and 
Steve Wozniak. 
Long before there was even an idea of a book, there were all the 
people and early adopters who wanted to learn about the WHY and 
use The Golden Circle to help build their organizations. This 
forward-thinking group were willing to embrace a new idea and 
were essential to helping me figure out many of the details and 
nuances of the concept. Thank you to Geoffrey Dzikowski, Jenn 
Podmore, Paul Guy, Kal Shah, Victor DeOliveria, Ben Rosner, 
Christopher Bates, Victor Chan, Ken Tabachnick, Richard Baltimore, 
Rick Zimmerman, Russ Natoce, Missy Shorey, Morris Stemp, Gabe 
Solomon, Eddie Esses and Elizabeth Hare, who saw the value of the 
WHY in building the most valuable organization of all— her family. 
Thank you to Fran Biderman-Gross, who is not only an early 
adopter, but who went out of her way to embrace her WHY in all 
aspects of her life and to encourage others to learn their WHY, too. 
Thank you to Congresswoman Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, 
Congressman Paul Hodes, and Congresswoman Allyson Schwartz,

who gave me so much and continue to give back to others with such 
passion. 
Over the years there were those who gave me a break and helped 
advance my cause. Thank you to Trudi Baldwin, the director of the 
Graduate Program in Strategic Communications at Columbia 
University (a wonderful program), Jim Berrien, who trusted me, the 
indefatigable Jack Daly, who teaches me, Piers Fawkes, Denis 
Glennon, who pushed me, Kevin Goetz, Tony Gomes, Paul 
Gumbinner, who gave me a career on a silver platter, Kenneth Hein, 
Peter Intermaggio, who taught me self-reliance, Pamela Moffat, Rick 
Sapio, who keeps doing good things for me, Alana Winter and Matt 
Weiss, for asking me to share my thoughts with an audience, and 
Diederik Werdmolder who took a bet on me right at the start. 
I am grateful to all the brilliant minds I have met within the U.S. 
Air Force who stuck their necks out to try something different. They 
embody the WHY of the USAF: to find and deliver better ways of 
doing things. To Maj. Gen. Erwin Lessel (who first introduced me to 
the organization), Maj. Gen. William Chambers, Brig. Gen. Walter 
Givhan, Brig. Gen. Dash Jamieson (who never stops believing), Maj. 
Gen. Darren McDew, Brig. Gen. (Sel) Martin Neubauer (who knows 
more than I will ever know), Christy Nolta, Brig. Gen. Janet 
Therianos and Lt. Col. Dede Halfhill (you owe me one, DeDe). 
I am immensely grateful to all the brilliant people and candid 
conversations that inspired so many of the ideas that became The 
Golden Circle and all its parts. Thank you to Kendra Coppey, who 
helped me out of the hole in late 2005 and to Mark Levy, who 
pointed me in the right direction. Thanks to Peter Whybrow, who 
saw a problem in America and helped me to understand the 
neuroscience of it all. Kirt Gunn, whose brilliant storytelling mind 
inspired the split. Every conversation with Brian Collins 
illuminated something new. Thank you to Jorelle Laakso, who 
taught me to reach for the things I believe in. To William Ury, who

showed me a path to follow, and Lt. Gen. David Deptula, who is 
probably the smartest person I know and gave me a new 
perspective for solving highly complex problems. 
My understanding of the WHY would be incomplete without 
the conversations, help and support of Nic Askew, Richard 
Baltimore, Christopher Bennett, Christine Betts, Ariane de 
Bonvoisin, Scott Bornstein, Tony Conza, Vimal Duggal, Douglas 
Fiersetin, Nathan Frankel, JiNan Glasgow, Cameron Herold, John 
Hittler, Maurice Kaspy, Peter Laughter, Kevin Langley, Niki 
Lemon, Seth Lloyd, Bruce Lowe, Cory Luker, Karl and Agi Mallory, 
Peter Martins, Brad Melt- zer, Nell Merlino, Ally Miller, Jeff 
Morgan, Alan Remer, Pamela and Nick Roditi, Ellen Rohr, Lance 
Piatt, Jeff Rothstein, Brian Scudamore, Andy Siegel, John Stepleton, 
Rudy Vidal, the 2007 and 2008 classes of the Gathering of Titans, 
and the one and only Ball of Mystery. 
To my late grandfather, Imre Klaber, who showed me that it is 
more fun to be slightly eccentric than to be completely normal. To 
my parents, Steve and Susan Sinek, who always encouraged me to 
follow the beat of my own drum. And to Sara, my remarkable, 
remarkable sister, who appreciates that I keep my head in the 
clouds but makes sure I keep my feet on the ground. 
There are a few books and authors that have, over the years, 
inspired me, spurred ideas and offered me new perspectives: the 
works of Ken Blanchard, of Tom Friedman and of Seth Godin, The 
Starfish and the Spider by Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom, First, 
Break All the Rules by Marcus Buckingham, Good to Great by Jim 
Collins, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey, The 
4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss, Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi, 
E-Myth by Michael Gerber, The Tipping Point and Outliers by 
Malcolm Gladwell, Chaos by James Gleick, Emotional Intelligence by 
Daniel Goleman, Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heath, Who Moved 
My Cheese? by Spencer Johnson, M.D., The Monk and the Riddle by

and the single most important book everyone should read, the book

I want to especially thank all those people who have joined this 
cause and actively work to inspire those around you. I am grateful 
for all the e-mails and notes you send me, I save them all as a re-
minder that it takes lots and lots of people, standing shoulder to 
shoulder, to have a real impact. 
And finally, to all those who read this book and pass it on to 
someone you believe it will inspire, thank you. I know that if 
enough of us learn about the existence of the WHY and work hard 
to start everything we do with WHY, we can and will change the 
world.
